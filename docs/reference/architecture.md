# Astrid Architecture

Astrid has three canonical public concepts:

- **Orchestrators** coordinate multi-step workflows.
- **Executors** run concrete work.
- **Elements** are render/custom building blocks such as effects, animations, and transitions.

Canonical packages and commands are first-class. `python3 -m astrid` is the
executable package gateway for the product families (projects, timelines, media,
tasks, runs, doctor, backup) and the two nested mounts (`timelines
shots`, `media references`). Capabilities (executors, orchestrators, elements)
are not gateway commands; they run through the SDK
(`astrid.sdk.invoke` / `astrid.sdk.client.AstridClient`).

## Onboarding Commands

From a cold checkout the gateway census and health check come first:

```bash
python3 -m astrid --help          # the complete product-family census
python3 -m astrid doctor --json   # read-only health check
python3 -m astrid projects list --json
```

There is no session-binding step and no `setup` command: product commands use
the selected workspace runtime. Project/run identity comes only from its
generated client (`projects.list/show`, `runs.list/show`); local project and
run JSON files are output/provenance artifacts, never selection authority.

Canonical discovery is the SDK; the `--json` CLI reads are the shell
equivalents:

```python
import astrid.sdk as sdk
result = sdk.discover()                       # every capability, pack by pack
cap = sdk.get_capability("rendering.render")  # typed lookup of one capability
```

Folder-backed orchestrators and executors include metadata such as
`orchestrator_root`, `executor_root`, and `stage_file`; agents should load the
top-level Astrid skill first, then open only the specific folder-level
`STAGE.md` needed for the selected registry item. Do not package every
executor and orchestrator stage into one merged runtime prompt.

Content ships in **packs** at `astrid/packs/<pack>/`. Each pack carries a `pack.yaml` with `id`, `name`, and `version`, and contains executor folders, orchestrator folders, and an `elements/<kind>/<id>/` tree. The shipped packs are `rendering`, `understanding`, `generation`, `editorial`, `video_editing`, `foley`, `training`, `youtube`, `fal`, `vibecomfy`, `runpod`, `moirae`, `iteration`, `media`, `stream_content`, `comfy_wrap`, `blender`, `discord_local`, and `seedance_local`. The deprecated `builtin` pack is a thin shell; legacy `external` and `upload` pack definitions were removed, and backward compatibility is via pack-level aliases declared in the canonical packs. A gitignored `local` pack at `astrid/packs/local/` holds user-edited element forks. Default orchestrators include `video_editing.hype`, `video_editing.event_talks`, and `video_editing.thumbnail_maker` (legacy aliases: `builtin.hype`, `builtin.event_talks`, `builtin.thumbnail_maker`). Default executors include every `STEP_ORDER` capability, upload/action executors, `understanding.understand` (audio/visual/video dispatcher), `generation.generate_image_openai` (with a `saint-peter-of-banodoco` onboarding preset), `moirae.moirae`, and `vibecomfy.run`/`vibecomfy.validate`.

Executor and orchestrator ids are always qualified — `<pack>.<name>` (for example `video_editing.cut`, `vibecomfy.run`). Bare lookups such as `cut` are rejected at the schema and CLI boundaries. Element ids stay bare and are scoped by `kind`, so `animation/fade` and `transition/fade` coexist without collision.

Each runnable orchestrator has exactly one canonical implementation location:
`astrid/packs/<pack>/<name>/{orchestrator.yaml,STAGE.md,run.py}` with
optional local `src/` modules. Each runnable executor has exactly one canonical
implementation location:
`astrid/packs/<pack>/<name>/{executor.yaml,STAGE.md,run.py}` with optional local
`src/` modules. Each element has exactly one canonical layout:
`astrid/packs/<pack>/elements/<kind>/<id>/{component.tsx,element.yaml}`.
Top-level `astrid/*.py` modules are shared libraries or
system commands only; they are not alternate executor or orchestrator
implementations.

For creation decisions, use `docs/guides/creating-tools.md` and the templates under
`docs/templates/`. Add an executor for one concrete action, an orchestrator for
a workflow, and an element for a reusable render primitive. Agents should avoid
manual chains of low-level stage artifacts unless they are debugging a specific
executor.

## Orchestrators

| Module or entry point | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python3 -m astrid`, `astrid/__main__.py` | System entry point | Executable package gateway for the product CLI families. |
| `astrid/core/gateway/` | System command and dispatcher | Routes the product families and the two nested mounts; one verb = one SDK call. No capability dispatch. |
| `astrid/packs/video_editing/orchestrators/hype/` | Orchestrator | Canonical hype video editing orchestrator. |
| `astrid/packs/video_editing/orchestrators/event_talks/` | Orchestrator | Canonical event-talk discovery and rendering workflow. |
| `astrid/packs/video_editing/orchestrators/thumbnail_maker/` | Orchestrator | Canonical source-evidence thumbnail workflow. |
| `astrid/core/execution/orchestrator/{runner,registry,schema,folder}.py` | Orchestrator framework | SDK-invoked runner (subprocess, `ASTRID_INTERNAL_INVOCATION=1`), pack-discovery registry, schema, and folder loader. |

## Executors

Every runnable tool is a built-in or external executor exposed from exactly one canonical folder under `astrid/packs/<pack>/<name>/`. The pack's id is the first segment of the executor's qualified id.

| Executor group | Canonical location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hype pipeline stages | `astrid/packs/{editorial,video_editing,rendering,understanding,foley}/*` | `STEP_ORDER` stages used by `video_editing.hype` (legacy alias: `builtin.hype`). |
| Understanding tools | `astrid/packs/understanding/{audio_understand,visual_understand,video_understand,understand}` | Concrete media understanding tools, plus a thin `understand` dispatcher executor that selects modality via `--mode`. |
| Standalone/service tools | `astrid/packs/{training,editorial,generation,rendering}/*` | Standalone executor capabilities across domain packs. `generate_image` is the multi-backend (local + cloud) image executor in `generation`; `generate_image_openai` is the OpenAI DALL-E executor, also in `generation`. |
| External tools | `astrid/packs/{moirae,vibecomfy,fal,runpod,youtube}/*` | `moirae.moirae`, `vibecomfy.run`, `vibecomfy.validate`, `fal.fal_foley`, `runpod.*`, `youtube.*`. Each adapter pack wraps a third-party substrate. Legacy `external.*` ids are deprecated pack-level aliases. |
| Iteration tools | `astrid/packs/iteration/assemble` | Runtime-owned project runs are read through the generated client; `iteration_video` invokes `iteration.assemble` and `rendering.render`. The retired `iteration.prepare` executor is not declared or invoked. |
| Upload tools | `astrid/packs/youtube/` | `youtube.upload` and `youtube.youtube_audio`. Legacy `upload.youtube` is a deprecated alias. |

Executor-owned complexity stays in the executor folder, usually under optional local `src/` modules. Hype/editing domain logic belongs with its owning pack under `astrid/packs/editorial/hype`; generic plumbing belongs in `astrid/utilities`.

## Element Support

| Module or path | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `astrid/core/element/schema.py` | Element support | `element.yaml` schema (`id`, singular `kind`, `pack_id`, `metadata`, `schema`, `defaults`, `dependencies`) and dependency dataclasses. |
| `astrid/core/element/registry.py` | Element support | Pack-driven resolution: active theme → `pack:local` (priority 10) → `pack:builtin` (priority 30). Fork copies into the local pack and rewrites `pack_id`. |
| `astrid/packs/rendering/elements/{effects,animations,transitions}` | Element support | Default elements shipped in the rendering pack; `kind`-scoped folders so `animations/fade` and `transitions/fade` coexist. |
| `astrid/packs/local/elements/<kind>/<id>` | Element support | Gitignored scratch pack where forked element copies land (auto-creates `astrid/packs/local/pack.yaml`). |
| `astrid/core/element/catalog.py` | Element support | Effect, animation, and transition catalog support used by render validation. |
| `scripts/gen_effect_registry.py` | Element support | Generates Remotion registries from the element registry; emits `@pack-<pack>-elements-<kind>/...` imports. |
| `scripts/gen_capability_index.py` | Capability discovery | Regenerates the capability index block in `astrid/packs/_core/skill/SKILL.md` from executor, orchestrator, and element manifests. |
| `astrid/timeline.py` | Shared library and element validator | Timeline schema and effect/animation/transition validation. |
| `remotion/*` | Element runtime support | TypeScript renderer consuming generated element registries via `@pack-builtin-elements-*` and `@pack-local-elements-*` aliases. |

## Shared Libraries

| Module or package | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `astrid/core/contracts/*` | Shared library | Common schema dataclasses for ports, outputs, cache, commands, and isolation. |
| `astrid/packs/editorial/hype/*` | Pack-owned domain library | Hype-cut/editing concepts such as arrangement rules, enriched arrangements, and text matching. |
| `astrid/core/util/llm_clients.py` | Utility library | Generic LLM client construction and environment handling. |
| `astrid/core/audit/*` | Shared library | Run-local provenance ledger, graph, and HTML report. |
| `astrid/core/theme/` | Shared library | Theme resolution, CLI, and schema validation helpers. |
| `astrid/core/paths.py` | Shared library | Repository and workspace path resolution. |
| `astrid/packs/editorial/executors/refine/src/reviewers/*` | Executor-owned library | Focused review heuristics used only by `editorial.refine`. |
| `astrid/packs/youtube/executors/upload/src/social_publish.py` | Executor-owned library | Social publishing client logic used by `youtube.upload`. |

This classification keeps only retained root and bin launchers; executor-owned public metadata and entrypoints live in canonical executor folders, and orchestrator-owned public metadata and entrypoints live in canonical orchestrator folders.

## Structure Enforcement

Repository structure enforcement, import layering rules, exemption lists, and
the `validate_repo_structure()` machinery are documented in
[docs/architecture/repo-shape.md](../architecture/repo-shape.md).

## Retired Concepts

**Task-mode CLI** is retired. The legacy `attach` / `next` / `start` / `ack`
verbs, the `executors run` / `orchestrators run` invocation surface, and the
old filesystem task-run store no longer exist; the eight-family CLI and the
SDK are the whole surface. The `astrid/core/task/` runtime and the
`text_analysis.summarize` and `builtin.agent_probe` orchestrators were
removed with it. Kernel task execution now lives in
`astrid/core/task_executor/` (the injected `TaskHandler` boundary for
pack-owned task-mode adapters).

**Threads** are retired as a user-facing concept. The `astrid thread` CLI
surface no longer exists. Threads are retained only as an internal lineage
model for iteration-video provenance; no current `astrid` command binds to
them at runtime.

## Generated Files and Dirty Worktrees

Normal generated outputs belong under `runs/` or another ignored directory. Do not commit source media, rendered videos, local dependency environments, or secrets.

Element changes may require generated Remotion registry updates. Keep `.ts`, `.js`, `.d.ts`, and `.map` siblings synchronized in `remotion/src`, then scan for stale element aliases:

```bash
python3 scripts/gen_effect_registry.py
rg "@workspace-|workspace-effects|workspace-animations|workspace-transitions" remotion/src scripts remotion -n
```

Always inspect `git status --short` before editing. Preserve unrelated user changes, especially dirty curated executor stage files such as `astrid/packs/moirae/executors/moirae/STAGE.md` and `astrid/packs/vibecomfy/executors/run/STAGE.md`.
