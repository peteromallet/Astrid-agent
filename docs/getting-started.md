# Getting Started with Astrid

New installation? Start with [Set up Astrid](setup/README.md), or give your agent the [setup checklist](setup/SKILL.md). The reference below covers additional SDK and rendering details.

Astrid is a Python SDK and harness toolkit for building and running
agentic UXes — pipelines where agents and humans collaborate to make art.

## Prerequisites

Astrid requires Python 3.11+. The runtime is a separate local service that
owns durable workspace state; the Astrid checkout is a client and pack source,
not the state store.

Install Astrid and configure the installed neutral launcher with an explicit
source-profile manifest. The first product command starts or reconnects that
runtime through the neutral launcher; no separate database service is needed:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
python3 -m pip install 'banodoco-workspace-runtime @ git+https://github.com/banodoco/banodoco-workspace-runtime.git@bc74a4b2179de83ace55c35fa6371f10e1e58610'
export BANODOCO_LOCAL_SOURCE_MANIFEST=/path/to/astrid-source-profile.json
python3 -m astrid --help
python3 -m astrid projects list --json
```

The checked-in `config/astrid-runtime.json` gives this Astrid checkout a
stable neutral-runtime support root at `Astrid/.astrid-data`. A wheel install
uses `~/.astrid-data`. Both defaults are independent of the current working
directory and are ignored by Git. The root contains the
launcher catalog, credentials, and the runtime realm directory; the runtime
continues to own the database and content-addressed objects. To choose another
installation-owned location explicitly, set `BANODOCO_LOCAL_DATA_ROOT` or pass
`--data-root /absolute/path` to `banodoco-local up` and subsequent lifecycle
commands. `BANODOCO_LOCAL_HOME` retains its macOS-home meaning and should not be
pointed at the Astrid checkout.

### Optional provider credentials

For VibeComfy-backed workflow import, editing, validation, and generation,
install the supported dependency from the canonical published repository:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --no-index --no-deps \
  artifacts/h3-candidate-wheels/vibecomfy-2.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

If you use provider-backed tools, set each API key once with the hidden prompt:

```bash
astrid-credential set runpod
```

Astrid stores it in `~/.astrid/astrid.env`. This is one file on this computer
for your current login, shared across your Astrid projects and checkouts. See
[Credential setup](reference/credentials.md) for supported providers,
overrides, and deployment guidance.

### Default Hivemind pack

Astrid setup provisions the canonical Hivemind repository at an immutable
revision, validates its strict v2 pack manifest, and composes its skill view.
The same managed source inventory is used by discovery and the generic host:

```bash
python3 -m astrid.setup
python3 -m astrid.setup --check --offline
python3 -m astrid.setup --disable-pack hivemind
python3 -m astrid.setup --restore-pack hivemind
```

### Optional Hivemind contributor login

Public Hivemind search and ordinary Astrid work do not require login. Login is
only needed when an agent is asked to contribute or ingest knowledge:

```bash
astrid login
astrid status
```

`astrid login` opens the Banodoco approval page and polls automatically. Approve
the Discord connection in the browser; do not type the displayed approval code
into the terminal. After the thank-you page, the terminal saves the contributor
credential at `~/.hivemind/key` with owner-only permissions. The machine label
and code shown on the page are for reference only.

Authenticated contributors can submit resources and propose revisions. Accepting
or rejecting revisions and marking guides canonical are editor-only actions; a
non-editor receives a clear `403 forbidden` response rather than being asked to
log in again.

To manage the local credential:

```bash
astrid logout   # remove only the local credential
astrid revoke   # revoke the server-side credential
astrid logout   # remove the revoked local credential
```

If `astrid status` reports `active` but a contribution returns `401
unauthorized`, login succeeded but the deployed Hivemind contribution function
or its database migration is not ready. Treat that as a deployment issue and
do not publish a real resource until the write path has been verified.

Use `ASTRID_SOURCE_DECLARATIONS` or `--declarations` for a local Git mirror
when developing offline. Skill sync is read-only with respect to source
acquisition; Hivemind corpus search and retrieval still require network access.

Use that environment for later commands too. The render worker checks its
dependencies in an isolated Python process, so user-site-only installations
are insufficient; install rendering dependencies into the active environment.

The pinned source install is temporary until the certified
`banodoco-workspace-runtime==0.1.0` wheel is published. Astrid resolves the
launcher from an explicit override, then the `banodoco-local` script, then the
installed `banodoco_local` module through the current Python interpreter. An
installed runtime therefore still works when its scripts directory is absent
from `PATH`.

An existing neutral source manifest can be used instead with
`BANODOCO_LOCAL_SOURCE_MANIFEST`. The manifest records both editable
checkouts and is retained under the runtime support directory after a
successful first launch so later `banodoco-local restart`/reconnect commands
use the same composition. The equivalent explicit operator command remains
`banodoco-local up --profile astrid`.

## Your First Command

From any shell with the runtime configured, check health:

```bash
python3 -m astrid doctor --json
```

Other useful zero-secret commands:

```bash
python3 -m astrid projects list --json
python3 -m astrid projects show demo --json
```

After a project has a successful timeline render, verify and open the newest
runtime render on macOS with:

```bash
python3 -m astrid projects select demo
python3 -m astrid runs open
```

Pass a run id positionally (`runs open <run-id>`) to open an exact successful
render, or use `--project <project>` to override the current project. The
command does not guess from checkout filenames or modification times.

If using the SDK directly, pass the loopback runtime endpoint and credential to
`AstridClient.open(...)` together with the runtime realm and actor identity.
Never point Astrid at a local SQLite/CAS directory; the runtime owns those
details.

`astrid doctor` remains a read-only diagnostic and does not create support
state. Product commands perform the bounded neutral launch/reconnect handoff
through `AstridClient.open_from_launcher()`. Ordinary SDK
`AstridClient.open()` calls remain explicit and never launch a process.

The seven top-level gateway families are `projects`, `timelines`, `media`,
`tasks`, `runs`, `doctor`, and `backup`; `timelines shots` and `media
references` are nested mounts. `doctor`
and `backup` use runtime routes. Backup supports create/restore/export and realm
lifecycle operations, with `--json` for a machine-readable result.

Runtime health, project identity, media objects, timeline versions, task/run
state, receipts, and events are authoritative only in the workspace runtime.
The SDK never owns or queries a local database or object-store index. It can
read a file location that the runtime has authenticated and verified.

### Upgrading an existing workspace

After installing updated Astrid and runtime packages, run:

```bash
astrid-upgrade
```

The command locates the existing workspace, stops its idle runtime and pack
host, applies the required migrations, moves an older store into the configured
Astrid data folder when needed, then restarts and verifies both services.
It preserves project identities and media, refuses to interrupt active work,
and can be rerun safely. Migration archives are retained for recovery; only the
current store is used during normal operation.

For the complete project, timeline, media, recovery, and failure journeys,
continue with [CLI journeys](guides/cli-journeys.md). For renderer-specific
diagnostics, see [Debugging](guides/debugging.md).

### Canonical timeline schema

The canonical `banodoco_timeline_schema` package is an optional external
dependency. Astrid's default Python install intentionally does not vendor or
declare this private Banodoco workspace package, so clean installs can use the
non-schema surfaces and import Astrid without that checkout. Timeline document
validation, managed rendering/visualization, and the exact canonical-schema
parity assertions require it and fail closed when it is unavailable.

The `dev` extra pins a compatible public source revision so the repository-wide
test suite and CI validate one deterministic schema. This does not add the
schema to Astrid's base runtime dependencies.

Install the package from a compatible Banodoco workspace checkout with the same
interpreter used to run Astrid:

```bash
python -m pip install -e /path/to/banodoco-workspace/packages/timeline-schema/python
python -c "import banodoco_timeline_schema; print('timeline schema available')"
```

The Astrid checkout does not contain `packages/timeline-schema/python`; replace
the placeholder with the path to the external workspace. If the package is not
installed, timeline validation fails closed with the installation message above.

### First visible timeline render

When hand-authoring a timeline, start with root `clips`, a `visual` track,
structured text marked explicitly as `clipType: "text"`, and an MP4 output:

```json
{"tracks":[{"id":"cards","kind":"visual","label":"Cards"}],
 "clips":[{"id":"title","at":0,"track":"cards","clipType":"text","hold":2,
   "text":{"content":"HELLO ASTRID","fontSize":64,"color":"#ffffff","align":"center"}}],
 "output":{"resolution":"640x360","fps":30,"file":"title.mp4"}}
```

The renderer rejects a structured `text` clip without `clipType: "text"` and
checks the default `.mp4` output suffix before starting a render, so these
mistakes do not consume a failed attempt.
