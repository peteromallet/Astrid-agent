# Timeline Visualization — Agent Navigation Contract (retired structural view)

> Retired: this document describes the former structural evidence route. It is
> preserved as historical release evidence only and is not an executable
> navigation guide. The current and only public surface is the paired rendered
> filmstrip; use `astrid/packs/rendering/skill/SKILL.md` for its commands.

*Status: M1 and M2 complete. Schema versions cited from
`astrid/packs/rendering/actions/timeline_visualize/schemas/` — every claim
below is grounded in the shipped code and release evidence, not the historical
plan.*
*Source of truth: this document + the schemas + the emitted artifacts of a
real run (see §1 for how to produce one).*

---

## 1. Overview

One command produces everything an agent needs to navigate a frozen timeline
snapshot:

```sh
astrid timelines visualize --project <slug>
```

The former default presentation is retained below for historical release
evidence. The public command now exposes only the rendered filmstrip/storyboard
unified inspector and requires a successful managed render.

- **stdout** is exactly one compact JSON object (`sort_keys`, no newline).
  Kernel-managed invocation returns a stable `run_id`, a durable
  `manifest_path`, and SDK outputs including `pack_root`, `pages`, and
  `file_hashes`; `run_root` is `null` because private attempt staging is
  removed after publication. This JSON is the agent's *only* input; it must
  never be derived from repository knowledge.
- **The authoritative evidence pack** is published as independently managed
  CAS objects. `manifest_path` is its durable navigation handle. For browsing,
  the SDK verifies and copies the logical pack to the derived project cache at
  `.astrid/views/timeline_visualize/<manifest-digest>/`; that directory is
  returned as `outputs.pack_root`, never shares inodes with CAS, and may be
  safely regenerated. It contains `manifest.json`, `frame-index.json`,
  `render-snapshot.json`, PNG pages, Markdown, and optional verified
  audio/media sidecars.
- **The offline inspection operation** is `astrid timelines inspect --manifest
  <manifest_path> --section <name>`. It verifies manifest-declared hashes,
  returns only named bounded projections, and supports opaque cursor
  pagination; it never starts the runtime or regenerates media.

Fresh-agent journey (proven by `tests/packs/rendering/
test_timeline_visualize_journey.py`, every step using a verbatim action argv):

```
stdout JSON → root manifest → TL01.focus_timestamp (whole-timeline TL focus;
desert has no pinnedShotGroups) → TL01.CL03.focus_context (--context 2) →
TL01.AS03.inspect_original (verified_original) → TL01.parent_view
```

## 2. Implemented schemas (all `schema_version: 1`)

Location: `astrid/packs/rendering/actions/timeline_visualize/schemas/`.
`_defs.json` is shared infrastructure (not an emitted artifact).

| Schema | File | Top-level fields |
|---|---|---|
| manifest | `manifest.json` | `schema_version` (1), `kind` (`timeline_visualize`), runtime-managed timeline identity and version inputs, `outputs`, `created`, `warnings`, `run_id` (ULID), `snapshots`, `compositor` metadata, `scope`, `layouts`, `page_count`, `reading_order`, `entrypoints`, `optional_formats`, `companions` |
| ground-truth | `ground-truth.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `project_slug`, `scope`, `objects` (identity triples), `timelines[]` (`timeline_ref`, `durations` (3 named extents), `tracks`, `clips`, `assets`), `frozen_objects`, `frozen_timeline`, `frozen_shots`, `frozen_ranges`, `timestamps.frozen_at` (sentinel, never SNS) |
| view-map | `view-map.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `pages[]` (`page_id`, `dimensions`, `layout`, `scope`, `time_bounds`, `object_boxes`, `labels`, `continuation_links`, `reading_order`), `reading_order` |
| action-index | `action-index.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `entries{ref: {canonical_ref, relations, actions}}` |
| asset-index | `asset-index.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `assets[]` (`stable_id`, `qualified_ref`, `canonical_ref`, `source_id`, `source_version`, `role`, optional frozen `media_type`, `integrity_state`, `expected_sha256`, `observed_sha256`, `contained_path`) |
| transcript-index | `transcript-index.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `sources[]` (TS), `speech_occurrences[]` (SP). Empty arrays remain valid when no explicit transcript evidence is attached; populated arrays preserve the same v1 shape |
| diagnostics | `diagnostics.json` | `schema_version`, `snapshots`, `diagnostics[]` (`severity` warning/error, `code` `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*`, `message`, `object_ref` nullable) |
| metric-definitions | `metric-definitions.json` | `schema_version` (1), `kind` (`timeline_visualize_metric_definitions`), `compositor_version` (`0.0.6`), `metrics[]` (14 fixed, ordered) |

`snapshots` is byte-identical across every artifact of one pack.

Manifest provenance fields are additive so older frozen v1 packs remain
valid. `source_mode` identifies kernel, explicit legacy, or frozen authority;
`resolved_timelines` retains the uppercase timeline-visualize v1 ULID
spelling; `canonical_timeline_identities` supplies the equivalent lowercase
kernel spelling for comparison with public timeline CLI/SDK DTOs. The required
Timeline provenance is identified by the runtime-managed timeline reference
and version/hash. Filesystem timeline paths and historical `timeline_source`
inputs are not supported and must not be used to infer source authority.

SDK admission records a read-only authority envelope in the immutable task
spec: the executor-definition digest plus either kernel stream head
(version/event/hash), legacy event-log SHA-256, or frozen manifest SHA-256,
focus, and SNS. The executor definition is fenced before project preparation;
the visualization runner then checks the selected source again at its actual
load boundary. This closes the admission-to-execution gap without making the
derived browse cache or `assembly.json` a second authority. A changed source
produces a typed failed task whose remedy is a fresh invocation.

New multi-timeline project indexes bind every child manifest by SHA-256. Older
schema-v1 indexes did not carry those additive fields; they remain readable by
deterministically reconstructing one completed owning task and fully verifying
each child pack, but the old root digest alone cannot distinguish two historical
tasks whose root bytes were identical. Rerun an old project-level visualization
before relying on it as exact multi-timeline provenance. Leaf packs and all newly
emitted project indexes retain exact hash-bound navigation.

## 3. Display-id grammar

- Qualified refs: `TL01`, `TL01.SH01`, `TL01.RG01`, `TL01.CL03`,
  `TL01.AS03`, `TL01.TS01`, `TL01.SP01` — pattern
  `^TL\d+(\.(SH|RG|CL|AS|TS|SP)\d+)?$` (`_defs.json#/$defs/qualified_ref`).
- Timestamp locators: `TL01@HH:MM:SS.fff` (also `MM:SS[.fff]` accepted as
  input) — `_defs.json#/$defs/timestamp_locator`.
- **Semantic identity** is `(timeline_uuid, kind, authored_id)` — the
  canonical ref. **Lineage-local display identity** is the qualified ref;
  `stable_id` is its suffix (`CL03`). The two are coupled only through the
  pack's identity map; display ordinals are allocated deterministically
  (`navigation.build_identity_map`): `TL01` always the timeline; `CL` in
  compositor clip order; `AS` in sorted registry-key order; `SH` in
  `pinnedShotGroups` order; `RG` minted by `assign_range_ids` in start-time
  order; `TS`/`SP` emitted by transcript attachment (R20).
- **Children never renumber**: scoped emissions filter entries; ordinals are
  never re-allocated (verified by the frozen child copying `frozen_objects`
  byte-for-byte).

## 4. Snapshot fields (SNS)

- SNS preimage (`snapshot_digest.sns_digest`, `SNS_SCHEMA_VERSION=1`):
  canonical JSON (`sort_keys`, `,`/`:` separators, `ensure_ascii`) of exactly:
  `schema_version`, `project_slug`, `timeline_uuid`, `timeline_ulid`,
  `head_version`, `head_last_event_id`, `head_last_hash`, `assembly_sha256`,
  `registry_sha256`, `media_hashes` (sorted), and optionally
  `transcript_sha256`. **Wall-time (`created_at`, `frozen_at`) is excluded**
  and any unknown key is rejected.
- `event_head`: `{version, last_event_id, last_hash}`; version 0 requires
  null tail fields. The event tail of the replayed log is authoritative —
  a stale `assembly.head.json` sidecar cannot change the SNS (R17 matrix
  Area 2).
- `fps`: `assembly.theme_overrides.visual.canvas.fps` (default 30).
- Compositor provenance: `compositor.package` (rendering pack),
  `version` = `COMPOSITOR_VERSION` (`"0.0.6"`), `registry_default_fingerprint`
  = sha256 of the pinned transition defaults (`{cross-fade: 8, fade: 8}`,
  `model._PINNED_TRANSITION_DEFAULTS`); the 12-frame hard fallback
  (`TRANSITION_FALLBACK_FRAMES`) is separate.
- `timestamps.frozen_at` is a fixed sentinel `2026-08-11T00:00:00Z` — never
  the wall clock, never in any preimage.

## 5. Offline inspection contract

The machine-facing path is a single bounded command over the materialized
filmstrip manifest:

```sh
astrid timelines inspect --manifest <manifest_path> --section cards --limit 5
```

Named sections are `summary`, `pages`, `cards`, `placements`, `audio`, and
`boundaries`. Exact selectors (`--frame`, `--card`, `--shot`, `--occurrence`,
`--clip`, `--track`, `--asset`) and half-open `--range START..END` compose with
the section; `--cursor` continues the same query. Responses are capped at 8
KiB and include typed errors rather than raw JSON dumps. The command verifies
declared member hashes before projecting records, never starts the runtime,
and never regenerates media.

## 6. CLI examples (real invocations)

```sh
# cold roots — project default timeline; mutually exclusive selectors
astrid timelines visualize --project desert                  # rendered filmstrip by default
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --render-run latest --every 5
astrid timelines visualize --project desert desert-slug      # by timeline slug
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --shot SH01
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --range 0..13.9  # closed-open window (frame-quantized)
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --at 00:00:08.500
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --clip plant-frame-3 --context 2 --neighbors 1
astrid timelines visualize --project desert --asset plant-frame-3

# presentation
--layout time-scaled|linear|both            # default both
--format png --format md                   # repeatable; default png,md
--view filmstrip --render-run latest       # the only visualization path

# bounded machine navigation
astrid timelines inspect --manifest <manifest_path> --section cards --shot SH01 --limit 5
astrid timelines inspect --manifest <manifest_path> --section audio --range 10..20
```

## 7. Source-integrity states (exact rules, `resolution.classify_asset` +
`assets.verify_now`)

| State | Rule |
|---|---|
| `verified_original` | expected sha256 recorded AND file present under `project_root/sources` AND `observed == expected` (re-verified right now for sampling) |
| `missing` | contained local path exists but the file is absent (or unreadable) |
| `hash_mismatch` | expected recorded, file present, `observed != expected` |
| `hash_unrecorded` | file present, no expected sha256 recorded (a fresh hash never retroactively verifies) |
| `remote` | reference is a URI / remote ref — never fetched |
| `thumbnail_only` | role derived thumbnail/proxy — no hash required, never substituted |
| `unsupported` | path escapes `sources/` (outside-sources, symlink-escape, no contained path) |

Sampling and original inspection are allowed **only** for `verified_original`
(`assets.guard_sampling`, `assets.verified_source_path`; no fallback, no
fetch).

## 8. Time semantics (from `metric-definitions.json`, compositor v0.0.6)

The five named timeline-level notions map to these metric ids (14 metrics
total; `unit` and `scope` are closed enums):

| Named notion | Metric id(s) | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| authored visual-only | `authored_visual_only_end_seconds` | max over visual-track clips of `authored.start + clip_source_duration` — no speed, no quantization (desert: 13.8667s) |
| frame-quantized visual | `frame_quantized_visual_end_frames` / `_seconds` | max independently rounded visual clip end frame (`Math.round`), seconds = frames/fps (desert: 332fr/13.8333s) |
| all-track composition | `all_track_composition_frames` / `_seconds`, `composition_extent` | `timeline_duration_frames` over EVERY clip (audio, muted, effect-layers included), one-frame floor (desert: 2352fr/98.0s) |
| visual-only span | `frame_quantized_visual_end_*` | the visual half of composition; no separate id exists in v1 (see report) |
| audible span | `audible_extent` | max frame-quantized end across audio-track clips / fps |

Compositor rule citations (`duration.py`): numeric `hold` wins
unconditionally over `from`/`to` (`clip_source_duration`, TS 7–13);
duration divides by raw `speed ?? 1` (`clip_timeline_duration`, TS 15–18);
frames use JS `Math.round` (half toward +∞) with a `max(1, …)` duration floor
(`clip_start_frame`, `clip_end_frame`, TS 3–5, 30–32); composition = max end
over all clips with 1-frame floor (`timeline_duration_frames`, TS 34–41);
transitions resolve explicit frames → rounded seconds → registered default
(8) → 12-frame fallback, ignored when non-positive or exceeding either clip
(`resolve_transition_duration_frames`, transitions.tsx 27–51,
TimelineComposition.tsx 196–200); visual tracks paint in **reverse config
order** (`visual_tracks_paint_order`, tracks.ts 9–14 + TC 314); v0.0.6
transition grouping mounts source `[F, F+Df)`, destination
`[F+Df−T, F+Df−T+Dt)` clipped to composition (model
`_transition_interval_maps`, TC 208–237). Per-scope metrics:
`clip_authored_interval`, `clip_frame_interval`, `clip_mounted_interval`,
`clip_effective_interval` (the transition-clipped presentation), 
`transition_resolved_duration_frames`, `clip_source_duration_seconds`.

## 9. Fixture ids (portable, deterministic)

- Portable slice: `tests/fixtures/timeline_visualize/desert_slice/`
  (event log `assembly.jsonl` v159, uuid
  `ed70ef66-43da-4182-9f14-69361c6c5e10`, ulid
  `01KYPVKMW5STB4W6FE05ED8242`, slug `plant-growth-storyboard`).
- `desert_truth.json` facts: fps 24; authored visual-only 13.8667s;
  frame-quantized visual 332fr / 13.8333s; all-track composition
  2352fr / 98.0s; audio clip `[12, 2352)`; `toccata-fugue` hash_unrecorded;
  no `pinnedShotGroups` (zero shots).
- Compositor parity fixtures `tests/fixtures/timeline_visualize/compositor_parity/`:
  F1 `F1_hold_only`, F2 `F2_from_to_speed`, F3 `F3_hold_speed_interaction`,
  F4 `F4_audio_extends_duration`, F5 `F5_muted_track_not_excluded`,
  F6 `F6_frame_rounding_edge`, F7 `F7_transition_bounds`,
  F8 `F8_z_order`, F9 `F9_speed-zero-rejected`,
  F10 `F10_transition-last-clip-ignored` (+ independent `oracle.py`).
- Deterministic verified media for journey tests: 4×4 RGB PNGs written under
  `project_root/sources/…` with the registry EVENT hashes aligned (see
  `test_timeline_visualize_journey.py::_write_verified_media`).

## 10. Transcript and speech interface (shipped in M2)

R20 identity rule: `TS` display ordinals remain lineage-local (`TL01.TS01`,
...), while their canonical authored identity is
`transcript:<full transcript_sha256>:segment:<declared-or-positional-id>`.
Changing transcript bytes therefore creates a different TS identity space even
when a fresh root happens to allocate the same display ordinal. An `SP`
canonical identity appends its carrying clip id; every `(TS, clip)` use is a
separate occurrence and reuse never collapses.

1. This document + the eight schemas (v1) as the contract.
2. `transcript-index.json` empty-valid shape: `sources` (TS: stable_id,
   qualified_ref, canonical_ref, asset_ref, transcript_sha256,
   source_segment_id, source_interval, speaker_state, speaker, text,
   word_timing, words) and `speech_occurrences` (SP: + source_ref, clip_ref,
   asset_ref, authored_mapping, effective_mapping) — `authored_mapping`
   preserves source-to-timeline arithmetic before compositor transitions;
   `effective_mapping` records the retimed/clipped presentation.
3. Action-index entries for TS/SP use `TL01.TSxx`/`TL01.SPxx` refs and add
   text/speech focus actions while keeping the v1 shape.
4. `reads: "current"` remains reserved for `refresh_root`; all transcript and
   speech navigation stays snapshot-read-only.
5. Cold `--range` scopes mint RG ids at root creation (e.g. `TL01.RG01`,
   ordered by start time, deterministic per bounds) so RANGE focus is
   navigable through the frozen preflight; see the implemented
   `assign_range_ids` integration in the executor path.
