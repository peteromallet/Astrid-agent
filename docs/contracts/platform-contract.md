# Astrid Platform Contract — v1

This document is the normative v1 platform contract for the public Python SDK,
manifest schemas, and the disclosure-only trust model. If this document and any
other SDK or pack-system doc disagree, this file wins.

For user-facing safe-use guidance, see [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md). For a
friendlier SDK walkthrough, see [docs/sdk.md](../reference/sdk.md).

## Contract Scope

Astrid v1 has one public Python import boundary:

```python
import astrid
```

The v1 contract is defined by:

- The exact top-level names exported by `astrid.__all__`
- The documented signatures and DTO categories reachable from `import astrid`
- The v1 manifest schema files under `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/`
- The disclosure-only trust/install rules in this document

The v1 contract is **not** defined by internal module layout, lazy-loader
implementation details, registry internals, or CLI implementation modules.

## Public SDK Boundary

### Supported Top-Level Exports

`astrid.__all__` is the source of truth for the supported top-level Python SDK
surface in v1. It contains exactly 28 names:

- Functions: `discover`, `get_capability`, `invoke`, `generate`,
  `read_events`, `subscribe_events`
- DTOs: `Capability`, `DiscoveryResult`, `EventStreamRecord`,
  `InvocationResult`, `CapabilityHandle`, `Port`, `Output`, `AliasRecord`,
  `Provenance`, `SafetyDeclaration`, `ExecError`
- Exceptions: `AstridSDKError`, `CapabilityNotFoundError`,
  `CapabilityAmbiguousError`, `CapabilityValidationError`,
  `CapabilityMissingInputError`, `CapabilityPreconditionError`,
  `CapabilityRuntimeError`, `CapabilityLeaseError`,
  `CapabilityEventLogError`, `UnsupportedCapabilityError`,
  `CapabilityInvocationError`

Anything importable from `astrid` outside this list is out of contract for v1.

### Public Boundary Rule

The supported import pattern is:

```python
import astrid
```

Callers may access the supported names as `astrid.<name>`. This is the public
boundary Astrid commits to for v1.

### Non-Contract Surfaces

The following surfaces are explicitly out of the v1 public contract, even if
they are importable today:

- `astrid.sdk` as a direct import target
- Everything under `astrid.core.*`
- Everything under `astrid.packs.*`
- Registry internals, resolver internals, and helper functions used to build
  DTOs
- CLI implementation modules and verb routing modules (for example gateway and command-entry internals)
- Internal tests, fixtures, and generated discovery payload shapes not exposed
  through the documented DTO contract

These surfaces may change in any minor or patch release without deprecation.

## SemVer And Deprecation

Astrid follows SemVer for the public boundary defined above.

- Patch releases may fix bugs and clarify behavior without breaking the
  documented v1 contract.
- Minor releases may add new top-level keyword parameters, DTO fields, manifest
  schema fields, and discovery metadata when those additions are backward
  compatible.
- Major releases may remove or break previously public v1 surfaces.

### Deprecation Window

The default deprecation window for a public v1 surface is **two minor
releases**.

Example: if a deprecation first ships in `1.4.0`, the surface remains supported
through `1.5.x` and may be removed no earlier than `1.6.0`.

This two-minor rule is the concrete v1 policy unless a stricter per-surface
guarantee is documented. It is intentionally conservative while broader SDK
governance remains lightweight.

Deprecations should use the existing alias/deprecation metadata model where
possible and should point callers at the replacement surface.

## DTO Stability Tiers

Astrid v1 uses three stability tiers for data returned from the public SDK.

### Tier 1 — Stable Contract Fields

These names, signatures, and top-level DTO fields are SemVer-guarded:

- Exported names in `astrid.__all__`
- Function signatures for `discover()`, `get_capability()`, `invoke()`,
  `generate()`, `read_events()`, and `subscribe_events()`
- The existence of these DTO types: `Capability`, `DiscoveryResult`,
  `InvocationResult`, `EventStreamRecord`, `CapabilityHandle`, `Port`,
  `Output`, `AliasRecord`, `Provenance`, `SafetyDeclaration`, `ExecError`
- `Capability` top-level fields: `id`, `capability_type`, `native_kind`,
  `handle`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `schema`, `defaults`, `definition`
- `DiscoveryResult` top-level fields: `executors`, `orchestrators`, `elements`,
  `capabilities`, `packs`, `generation_backends`, `element_kinds`,
  `generation_features`, `generation_modes`
- `InvocationResult` top-level fields: `capability_id`, `capability_type`,
  `native_kind`, `ok`, `error`, `manifest_path`, `raw_result`
- `EventStreamRecord` top-level fields: `source`, `line`, `timestamp`, `kind`,
  `hash`, `payload`
- The exported exception names and their place in the public exception family

### Tier 2 — Evolving/Additive Fields

These fields are part of the public contract, but may grow additional keys or
keyword parameters in minor releases:

- Fields on `CapabilityHandle`, `Port`, `Output`, `AliasRecord`, `Provenance`,
  `SafetyDeclaration`, and `ExecError`
- New keyword-only parameters on `discover()`, `get_capability()`, `invoke()`,
  and `generate()`
- The key sets of `to_dict()` results for public DTOs
- Pack records in `DiscoveryResult.packs`
- Records in `DiscoveryResult.generation_backends`,
  `DiscoveryResult.element_kinds`, `DiscoveryResult.generation_features`, and
  `DiscoveryResult.generation_modes`

Tier 2 means Astrid will not silently remove or rename existing documented
fields in a v1 minor or patch release, but additive growth is allowed.

### Tier 3 — Opaque/Evolving Payloads

These values are public return fields, but their internal key names, nesting,
and value shapes are intentionally treated as opaque payloads:

- `Capability.schema`
- `Capability.definition`
- `Capability.defaults`
- `InvocationResult.raw_result`
- `InvocationResult.error`
- `EventStreamRecord.payload`
- Nested output of `DiscoveryResult.to_dict()`

Callers may serialize these payloads, display them, or pass them through, but
should not build brittle logic around undocumented nested keys.

## Manifest And Schema Contract

### Canonical v1 Manifest Files

Astrid v1 recognizes these manifest families:

- Pack manifests: `pack.yaml`, `pack.yml`, or `pack.json`
- Executor manifests: `executor.yaml`, `executor.yml`, or `executor.json`
- Orchestrator manifests: `orchestrator.yaml`, `orchestrator.yml`, or
  `orchestrator.json`
- Element manifests: `element.yaml`, `element.yml`, or `element.json`

The schema contract for those manifests is defined by the JSON Schema files
under `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/`.

### Normative v1 Schema Files

All v1 manifest schema files are part of the contract:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/pack.json` | Validates pack manifests and pack-level declarations |
| `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/executor.json` | Validates executor manifests |
| `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/orchestrator.json` | Validates orchestrator manifests |
| `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/element.json` | Validates element manifests |
| `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/_defs.json` | Shared schema definitions referenced by the manifest schemas above |

The v1 contract covers the existence and intended roles of these files. It does
not promise byte-for-byte immutability of schema internals; backward-compatible
validation additions may land in minor releases.

### Stable Vs Opaque Manifest Areas

Stable manifest contract areas include:

- Which manifest families exist
- Which top-level schema files validate them
- Pack-level permissions being declared in the pack manifest
- Executor/orchestrator secrets being declared in their component manifests
- The existence of alias/deprecation metadata in pack manifests

Opaque or evolving manifest areas include:

- Undocumented nested schema keys
- Generator-facing metadata used only by internal discovery/build tooling
- Exact serialized ordering of manifest keys
- Any internal registry-only normalization details not surfaced through the
  public SDK

## Element Extension APIs

Astrid v1 supports pack-declared generation and element extensions through the
pack manifest `extensions` block. The stable v1 contract is the manifest shape,
external-pack discovery path, and public SDK discovery records described here.
The internal registries and adapter protocols that consume these records remain
provisional.

### Generation Extensions

Packs may declare generation extensions under:

- `pack.extensions.generation.backends`
- `pack.extensions.generation.features`
- `pack.extensions.generation.modes`

The stable v1 contract for generation extensions is:

- These fields are valid pack-manifest fields under
  `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/pack.json`.
- `generation.backends` entries declare inert backend descriptors with `id`,
  `module`, `class`, optional `label`, and optional `init_kwargs`.
- `generation.features` and `generation.modes` entries may be strings or
  objects with `id`, optional `label`, and optional `description`.
- Packs discovered through source packs, explicit SDK `extra_pack_roots`,
  `ASTRID_PACKS_PATH` can contribute these
  declarations.
- `astrid.discover()` exposes normalized records through
  `DiscoveryResult.generation_backends`,
  `DiscoveryResult.generation_features`, and
  `DiscoveryResult.generation_modes`.

The v1 SemVer guarantee covers the existence of those manifest locations, the
required/optional field names listed above, and the existence of the matching
`DiscoveryResult` tuple fields. Minor releases may add optional descriptor
fields or new built-in records, but will not remove or rename these v1 fields
without the normal two-minor deprecation window.

The following generation details are provisional or opaque in v1:

- The Python backend adapter base class and registry implementation under
  `astrid.core.generation.*`
- The exact constructor/import behavior for backend classes beyond the manifest
  descriptor fields
- The complete built-in taxonomy of feature ids, mode ids, backend ids, labels,
  and descriptions
- Nested `init_kwargs` contents
- Ordering of discovery records, except that records are returned as tuples and
  are safe to serialize

### Element Kind Extensions

Packs may declare element-kind extensions under
`pack.extensions.elements.kinds`. Each entry declares an `id` and may include
`singular`, `plural`, `label`, and `description`.

The stable v1 contract for element extensions is:

- `pack.extensions.elements.kinds` is a valid pack-manifest field under
  `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/pack.json`.
- External packs loaded through `ASTRID_PACKS_PATH` can declare element kinds
  and elements using those kinds.
- `astrid.discover()` exposes normalized element-kind records through
  `DiscoveryResult.element_kinds`.
- Element capabilities discovered from those packs remain visible through the
  public SDK as `Capability` DTOs with `capability_type == "element"`.

The v1 SemVer guarantee covers the manifest field names above and the existence
of `DiscoveryResult.element_kinds`. Minor releases may add optional descriptor
fields or additional built-in element kinds without deprecation.

The following element details are provisional or opaque in v1:

- The registry/typegen implementation that maps aliases to canonical element
  kind names
- Internal React/TypeScript component conventions for element rendering
- Nested `Capability.schema`, `Capability.defaults`, and
  `Capability.definition` payload shapes for elements

### Extension Boundary

The generation and element extension APIs are pack-authoring and discovery
APIs, not a promise that every declared extension can be invoked through
`astrid.invoke()`. In v1, `astrid.invoke()` supports executors and
orchestrators; passing an element capability raises `UnsupportedCapabilityError`.

Callers should use `astrid.discover()` and `astrid.get_capability()` for
extension discovery, serialize opaque payloads rather than depending on nested
internal keys, and treat direct imports from `astrid.core.*` or
`astrid.packs.*` as outside the public v1 SDK contract.

## Disclosure-Only Trust And Security

This section preserves the existing v1 trust/security contract as a first-class
part of the platform boundary.

### V1 Trust Block Invariants

Every pack trust summary carries this fixed v1 trust block:

```python
V1_TRUST_BLOCK = {
    "sandbox": "none",
    "runs_with_user_process_permissions": True,
    "permission_enforcement": "disclosure_only",
}
```

These values are v1 invariants. They will not change within the v1 major
version.

### Permissions Are Pack-Level Disclosure Metadata

Permissions are declared at the pack level only in v1. There is no separate
per-executor or per-orchestrator permission contract.

The `permissions` field in the pack manifest:

- Requires `id` and `reason`
- Allows optional `access` and `services`
- Rejects unknown keys
- Is validated by `astrid/core/pack/schemas/v1/pack.json`

Permissions are disclosure metadata. They do **not**:

- Create sandbox rules
- Configure `IsolationMetadata`
- Enforce runtime allow/deny checks
- Restrict filesystem, subprocess, network, or environment access

The canonical statement of that boundary is
`permission_enforcement: disclosure_only`.

### Secrets Are Separate From Permissions

This distinction is part of the v1 contract:

| Concept | Declared In | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Permissions | Pack manifest | Capability domains such as network, files, subprocess, environment |
| Secrets | Executor/orchestrator manifests | Specific environment variable names |

Permissions answer "what kind of access does this pack claim to use?" Secrets
answer "which variable names does this component claim to read?"

### Source-Pack Inspection Contract

Pack inspection and SDK discovery are the canonical source of pack identity,
entrypoints, dependencies, and declared permissions. They read editable source,
project-local, explicit extra-root, and environment pack trees; no user-level
installed-pack store participates in public discovery.

The trust summary includes:

- Pack identity and version
- Component counts and entrypoints
- Declared secrets and dependencies
- Structured permissions and compact `permission_ids`
- The v1 trust block
- Advisory warnings

Consumers must not reconstruct this data independently.

## Validation Boundary

`python3 -m astrid.core.pack.cli validate` performs static manifest validation. In v1 it
checks schema/shape validity, not runtime behavior. Validation does not promise
that a pack behaves safely or only does what its declarations describe.
