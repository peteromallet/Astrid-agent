# Agent CLI Contract

This document defines the stable public contract between Astrid's CLI and
agentic consumers (both human operators and AI agents).  It covers stream
discipline, output modes, error signaling, and the behavioral guarantees
that agents can rely on when invoking Astrid subcommands.

The gateway owns **exactly seven families** — the five product families
(`projects`, `timelines`, `media`, `tasks`, `runs`) and the two
operational families (`doctor`, `backup`) — plus the two
manifest-declared nested mounts (`timelines shots`, `media references`).
One verb = one SDK call. No other top-level command exists; see
[the CLI census](../getting-started.md) and
[CLI journeys](../guides/cli-journeys.md).

## Stream Discipline

Every Astrid CLI invocation observes strict stdout/stderr separation:

| Stream | Content | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **stdout** | Command result surface | The human-readable result line, or (in `--json` mode) exactly one JSON document.  Agents read stdout for the command outcome. |
| **stderr** | Diagnostics and structured errors | Error envelopes, `valid options:` / `recovery:` lines, and pure diagnostics.  Agents parse stderr for structured recovery guidance. |

### Default Mode (Human-Readable)

In default mode (no `--json`), stdout carries the command result: for a
mutation, one concise identity line (e.g. the created project slug and id);
for a read, the requested listing or detail in plain text.

Stderr in default mode carries only true diagnostics: typed error envelopes
and recovery guidance.

### JSON Mode (`--json`)

When a product or nested-mount command accepts `--json`, stdout contains
**exactly one JSON document** — one line, one object, terminated by a single
`\n`. No preamble, no prose, no separator. This is the sole five-key
machine-contract path for those commands. `doctor --json` is intentionally a
different read-only diagnostic surface (its object contains `state`, `checks`,
`next_action`, and `ok`); `serve` and `backup` do not accept `--json`.
Agents should follow each verb's help rather than assume every operational
family has the product envelope.

The JSON payload is the frozen five-key envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {"id": "…", "slug": "demo"},
  "error": null,
  "receipt": {
    "receipt_id": "…",
    "command_kind": "…",
    "idempotency_key": "…",
    "request_hash": "…",
    "project_id": "…",
    "project_seq": [1, 1],
    "event_ids": ["…"],
    "result": {"…": "…"},
    "created_at": "…"
  },
  "idempotency_key": "…"
}
```

| Key               | Meaning                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ok`              | `true` on success, `false` on a typed SDK error                    |
| `data`            | the command's result payload (`null` on failure)                   |
| `error`           | a frozen error object (`{code, message, details}`) or `null`       |
| `receipt`         | the committed command receipt on mutations, `null` on reads/failure|
| `idempotency_key` | caller-supplied key, or the key the SDK generated before mutation  |

Stderr in JSON mode may carry `valid options:` / `recovery:` lines and the
structured error envelope. Agents should parse `recovery:` from stderr as
the canonical next command.

### Design Decisions (Settled)

These decisions are locked and must not be re-litigated:

- **SD1**: `--json` is the sole machine-contract path.  It never includes
  preamble or prose — exactly one JSON object on stdout.
- **SD2**: Recovery guidance (`valid options:` / `recovery:`) lives on
  stderr in both modes, so the stdout contract stays parseable.
- **SD3**: Exit-code taxonomy is `0`=success (envelope `ok=true`), `1`=typed
  SDK error (envelope `ok=false`), `2`=usage/parse error (argparse).
- **SD4**: Help is side-effect-free. Top-level, family, and verb help parses
  without opening, migrating, or locking the selected project database; it
  remains printable while the workspace runtime exclusively owns that database.

## Verb Reference

The gateway families and their verbs:

- **`projects`** — `create`, `list`, `show`, `update`, `select`, `current`.  `select`
  persists a non-authoritative default-project preference (file-side only; no
  receipt, no DB mutation).
- **`timelines`** — `create`, `list`, `show`, `save`, `archive`, `unarchive`,
  `history`, `diff`, `visualize`, `render`.  `save` is a whole-document
  compare-and-swap; a stale `--expected-version` is the typed
  `stale_version` and changes nothing. `visualize` emits a run-owned evidence
  pack, while `render` accepts a pinned canonical timeline.
- **`media`** — `import`, `list`, `show`, `verify`, `relate`.
  The only supported realm is the runtime-managed `managed_local` CAS;
  reference-in-place (`external_local`), `remote`, and `relocate` are not
  product or SDK operations. `verify` requires `--realm managed_local` and
  accepts `--location-id`/`--locator` selectors;
  `relate` has the frozen five-kind
  `--kind` (`derived_from`, `variant_of`, `uses_as_input`, `mask_for`,
  `audio_for`).
- **`tasks`** — `create`, `list`, `show`, `cancel`, `retry`, `events`.
  `create` admits one immutable task (`--capability` + JSON `--spec`).
- **`runs`** — `list`, `show`, `cancel`, `retry-failed`, `events`.
  `retry-failed` is the batch-retry surface (all-failed-children by default,
  explicit repeatable `--task` subset otherwise).
- **`doctor`** — read-only health check (`schema_versions`, managed and
  runtime-managed media-byte integrity, SQLite quick-check, FK status, and
  bounded orphan-staging diagnostics).
- **`backup`** — `create` (staged, validated, `--out`) and `restore`
  (journaled, idempotent).

Nested mounts (manifest-declared, never top-level):

- **`media references`** — `create`, `update`, `archive`, `associate`,
  `link`, `set-primary`, `list`, `show`.
- **`timelines shots`** — project-level reusable `list`, `create`, `show`, `add`, `remove`, `reorder`.

There is no `next` / `status` / `attach` / `start` / `ack` surface: the
legacy task-mode CLI was retired with the filesystem task-run store.  Pack
capabilities are not gateway commands either — they run through the SDK
(`astrid.sdk.invoke`, `astrid.sdk.client.AstridClient`).

## Error Contract

All recoverable CLI failures travel through the `AstridError` envelope defined
in `astrid/core/contracts/errors.py`.  See [docs/error-model.md](error-model.md) for
the full taxonomy, envelope fields, rendering contract, and authoring rules.

Key points for agents:

- **Exit code 1** means a typed SDK error (`ok=false` in JSON mode).  Parse
  the `error` envelope for the `code`; retry only when the error contract
  says the operation is retryable.
- **Exit code 2** means a usage/parse error.  `valid options:` lists the
  accepted values and `recovery:` suggests the correct invocation.
- **Parser errors** (`AstridArgumentError`) are converted to `AstridError`
  envelopes with `valid_options` listing the accepted values and a
  `recovery_command` suggesting the correct invocation.
