# Debugging Astrid projects and renderers

Start with the project health and recovery checks below. The renderer notes
then cover the same failure-first approach for a local backend. Normative
renderer wire details live in [render-backend-v1.md](../contracts/render-backend-v1.md).

## 1. Installed Runtime diagnostics

Confirm the installed owner and selected support root before investigating a
product error. These commands are read-only and do not require an Astrid or
Runtime checkout:

```bash
astrid-local --provenance
astrid-local workspace inspect --data-root "$ASTRID_LOCAL_DATA_ROOT" --json
astrid status --json
astrid doctor --diagnostic --json
```

Use one absolute `ASTRID_LOCAL_DATA_ROOT` for every command. If the launcher
is unavailable, activate the installed virtual environment first. A legacy
`BANODOCO_LOCAL_DATA_ROOT` value is accepted with a warning; setting both
names to different roots fails closed. Installed diagnostics must not be
repaired by adding `PYTHONPATH` or pointing at a sibling checkout. For an
editable development profile, set `ASTRID_LOCAL_SOURCE_MANIFEST` explicitly
and keep that profile separate from installed qualification.

`status` reports workspace, Runtime, readiness, and optional contribution auth.
`doctor --diagnostic` emits the bounded C2 document. A diagnostic keeps these
states distinct:

| State | Meaning | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| `unknown` | The fact was not observed | collect the missing observation |
| `stopped` | Runtime or Worker is not running | use explicit setup or Worker start |
| `stale` | The observation exceeded its freshness bound | collect a fresh read |
| `mismatched` | Identity, root, epoch, or digest differs | stop and reconcile the selected composition |
| `failed` | An observed operation failed | fix the typed failure before retrying |
| `healthy` | The bounded observation passed | continue with the requested operation |

`astrid doctor --diagnostic --shared` redacts paths, credentials, command
arguments, and executable next actions for shared output. Read commands never
start or repair a service. `astrid worker start --json` is the separate,
explicit lifecycle action.

## 2. Project health and recovery

Use the read-only doctor first through the explicit runtime launcher:

```bash
astrid doctor --diagnostic --json
```

On a pristine root, `state: "uninitialized"` with `ok: true` is expected and
the report tells you to create a project; it is not a hidden store failure.
After initialization, `state: "ready"` means healthy and `state:
"unhealthy"` or a failed check means investigate. Treat `schema_versions: fail`
as a migration or schema incompatibility. If a
product CLI command returns `error.code=unavailable` with
`error.details.reason=store_owned`, wait for the active local owner to release
the store. Reads may retry after release. For writes, keep the exact payload and
idempotency key, retry only after release, and verify state. Keep the original
project unchanged while selecting a compatible checkout or retrying after the
owner exits. A stale timeline save is expected to return
`timeline_version_conflict` over HTTP 409 or `stale_version` through the SDK;
reload the current version, merge the draft, and retry the compare-and-swap
save.

For media integrity failures, `media verify` is a read-only check. Missing or
mutated bytes are rejected consistently and surface as the typed
`integrity_error` code in the public envelope; restore or re-import the exact bytes
instead of editing the digest path. For an interrupted restore, repeat the
restore command or restart the local runtime. The durable restore journal is read
before writer construction, so recovery publishes only a complete old or new
state.

```bash
python3 -m astrid media verify M_01ABC --project demo \
  --realm managed_local --json
python3 -m astrid backup restore ./backup --destination ./restore-target --json
```

## 3. Worker and migration recovery

Worker startup is Runtime-owned. Use the product command and retain its typed
handoff or failure:

```bash
astrid worker start --json
```

Do not run `run_worker.py`, `worker.py`, or a direct database/task loop to
repair a missing Worker. Those paths cannot establish the selected workspace,
lease, fence, or credential identity. For a migration, use the Runtime-owned
upgrade path and keep the archive until success:

```bash
astrid-upgrade
astrid-local upgrade --data-root "$ASTRID_LOCAL_DATA_ROOT" --json
```

Never open SQLite/CAS files from Astrid, copy a previous root into place, or
add `PYTHONPATH` to hide an installed provenance problem.

## 4. Local renderer debugging

Keep renderer work local and deterministic. Validate the request and output
shape before investigating backend behavior, retain redacted logs, and never
publish a sidecar until the output exists, is non-empty, and matches its
declared hash/profile. A renderer failure is not a project save failure: keep
the timeline and its draft, inspect the failure record, and retry only after
the reported input or binary condition is corrected.

The structured renderer failure kinds are:

| kind | Meaning | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | Missing or malformed result | Re-read the request and result schema. |
| `unsupported` | The request is not supported | Choose a supported input or fallback. |
| `binary_missing` | A required local binary is absent | Install or configure that binary. |
| `timeout` | The deadline expired | Shorten the work or raise the explicit deadline. |
| `interrupted` | The host cancelled the run | Retry after the host is stable. |
| `invalid_artifact` | Output is missing, empty, escaping, or hash-mismatched | Fix the output path and digest. |
| `internal` | Unexpected backend failure | Preserve the redacted log and fix the backend. |

## 5. SDK-level diagnostics

A backend written against the rendering SDK can use `astrid.support(...)` for
a request-sensitive support report. Product renders must be admitted through
`astrid.sdk.invoke("rendering.render", kind="executor", project=..., inputs=...)`;
the workspace runtime's generic host owns execution, materialization, and
settlement. The retired direct-render symbol is a fail-closed compatibility
guard and must not be used for rendering. `RenderContext.run(..., check=False)`
returns a bounded subprocess result, and `RenderContext.log`/`progress` keeps
diagnostics redacted. The full SDK example is in [reference/sdk.md](../reference/sdk.md).

For any project-facing failure, return to `doctor --json`, inspect the typed
error envelope (including `internal_error` when an unexpected backend failure
is mapped at the public boundary), and preserve the old state until a complete
replacement is available.
