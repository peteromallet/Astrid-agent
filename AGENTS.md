# Astrid

When in doubt, run `python3 -m astrid --help` — it prints the complete
seven-family census (projects, timelines, media, tasks, runs,
doctor, backup). For the agent-facing skill, see
[astrid/packs/_core/skill/SKILL.md](astrid/packs/_core/skill/SKILL.md).
For the human setup path, see
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

> **Format note:** This root AGENTS.md is intentionally minimal. It
> diverges from the pack-level `AGENTS.md` convention of structured
> sections (overview, quick-start, capabilities, cli-verbs, etc.) because
> the canonical agent-facing skill is `_core/skill/SKILL.md`, not this
> file. The root AGENTS.md exists only to provide a quick pointer to
> the CLI census and the core skill — it is a redirect, not a full skill
> document. Pack-level AGENTS.md files within each pack follow the
> structured-section format; this root file does not.

## Backup and snapshot policy

- Persist a full workspace or realm backup only when the user explicitly asks
  for one. Do not create extra full copies, archives, or rollback snapshots
  before routine edits, launches, migrations, or repairs.
- Use the runtime-owned `astrid backup create --out <external-path>` flow for
  a requested realm backup. Do not copy the live realm or `.otto` run history
  as a substitute.
- The multi-root rollback snapshot utility is also persistent backup creation.
  It requires both `--retain-backup` and an explicit `--out-dir` outside the
  repository and projects root.
