# `make check` green ≈ the CI "Python quality gates" deploy job will pass its fast gates.
# These run the SAME scripts CI runs (see .github/workflows/ci.yml), so they stay in lockstep.

# Runs the complete fresh-database, conformance, crash, contention, lint,
# runtime, and provider lane hermetically (fresh ASTRID_PROJECTS_ROOT /
# ASTRID_HOME, scrubbed task env) and retains a machine-readable summary plus
# per-lane logs and JUnit XML under out/s1-gate/latest (gitignored). CI uploads
# that directory with `if: always()` so evidence survives failures. This is the
# SAME target the local CI mirror (run_ci_checks.sh) and GitHub Actions invoke,
# keeping both entry points in lockstep. PY overrides the interpreter (e.g. a
# runtime venv that provides banodoco_timeline_schema for schema lanes).

# per-selector pass/fail, and timestamps. The script fails closed: a failed,

# rejection, the Python 3.11/3.12 matrix, and the present-accepted
# feasibility admission. Fails closed on any missing/rejected admission,
# drift, or lane failure. Evidence: per-lane
