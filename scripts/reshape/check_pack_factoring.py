"""Deterministic packaged and temporary-copy factoring checks.

Proves that each in-tree schema pack (``timeline``, ``shots``, ``references``,
``runaway``)
can be removed **only inside a temporary source copy** -- both the pack
directory and the explicit standard registration tuple
(``astrid.packs.STANDARD_SCHEMA_PACKS``, which drives
``register_standard_schema_packs``) -- while the complete enumerated kernel
test lane stays green and the remaining manifest-derived catalog is
unchanged.

The original source-composition proof remains available for the v10 regression
floor. The packaged mode starts from one unpacked wheel, removes one standard
schema pack at a time, patches only the explicit registration tuple, and runs
the same complete kernel lane against that artifact root. Both modes are
throwaway checks: the real repository and the supplied wheel are never mutated.

Lane completeness
-----------------
The enumerated :data:`KERNEL_LANE` is the fixed, complete set of kernel test
files under ``tests/v10`` that import no domain schema pack at module level
and whose assertions hold under *any* subset of the four packs:

- kernel repositories/execution: fanout (run creation/continuation), the
  multi-task journey, task races, evidence, media, projects, receipts/events,
  writer/UoW, task lifecycle, task admission, task executor;
- capability adapters that stay kernel-owned (generation roundtrip,
  capability roundtrip, understanding repository);
- the deterministic authority lint (pure text fixtures under ``tmp_path``).

Deliberately excluded suites (asserted separately, see below):

- ``test_registry.py`` / ``test_catalog_migrations.py`` assert the exact
  *standard* 4-pack composition, so they cannot
  run under a reduced composition; the check's own catalog verification step
  re-derives the remaining manifest-derived catalog from the modified
  registration instead.
- ``test_timeline_repository.py``, ``test_reference_*``, ``test_shot_*`` and
  the three conformance files import the domain packs at module level.
- ``test_contention.py`` / ``test_crash_atomicity.py`` import the timeline
  repository at module level.
- ``test_media_pipeline.py`` exercises the standard host composition
  (``compose_standard_bridge`` / startup staging GC) which legitimately
  requires the timeline pack.

The remaining catalog is verified deterministically for every removal:
core + the three remaining packs compose to exactly
``CORE_TABLES | (all pack tables - the removed pack's tables)``, the removed
pack is absent from the frozen registry and the registration tuple, and a
fresh database opened from the modified composition contains exactly the
remaining tables (never the removed pack's).

Packaged mode additionally checks that the removed pack's stream, event,
command, repository, CLI, and bridge vocabulary is absent, every foreign key
stays within the kernel or its owning pack, and every remaining SDK service
uses the one writer supplied by the composition.

Sketch verification
-------------------
The check also locks the software-engineering-agent composition sketch
(:data:`SKETCH_DOC`): the sketch's declared kernel inventory is parsed from
the document and compared for exact equality against the inventory derived
from ``CORE_MIGRATIONS`` (:data:`CORE_KERNEL_TABLES`). The sketch therefore
cannot silently add a kernel table, and its own in-tree packs
(:data:`SKETCH_PACKS`) stay disjoint from the Astrid standard packs. Like the
removal proof, this is a read-only source-composition check: no database is
opened, no runtime discovery or loader exists, and nothing is installed or
uninstalled.
