"""Regression for editorial/quality_zones SHA TOCTOU between main() and compute().

Pre-fix bug: ``main()`` hashed the file bytes for the cache key, then
``compute()`` re-hashed the file bytes for the report's ``source_sha256``
field. If the file was rewritten between those two reads, the cache key and
the recorded SHA would diverge — silently corrupting the on-disk cache.

The fix (SD3) adds a ``source_sha256: str | None`` parameter to ``compute()``
that, when provided by ``main()``, suppresses the inner re-read. ffmpeg still
reads the on-disk Path (it needs a real file), but the recorded SHA always
matches the caller's single source of truth.
