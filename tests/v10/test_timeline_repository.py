"""Timeline repository tests: create, address resolution, list, and show.

(m1 plan step 13 / T27 and NSA-3.) This suite proves the timeline identity
projection contract end to end:

- create atomicity: one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` command writes the
  ``timeline.timeline`` stream, the whole-document ``timelines`` projection,
  one hash-chained ``timeline.created`` event (canonical SD2 envelope), both
  heads, and the complete receipt together; every failure path (slug/ULID
  conflict, existing id, validation, receipt mismatch) changes zero rows;
- canonical identities: the timeline id is a lowercase canonical UUID
  (``8-4-4-4-12``) and the alias is a lowercase 26-character Crockford ULID,
  both persisted only inside the ``timeline.created`` envelope (SD1);
- address resolution: UUID, lowercase ULID, and immutable slug all resolve
  within one project (bridge §8 order), with typed missing-project,
  missing-timeline, and invalid-address errors;
- alias uniqueness under ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``: the slug and ULID uniqueness
  queries run inside the command's transaction over the project's
  ``timeline.created`` events — there are no convenience columns;
- wrong-project isolation: the same slug/ULID in another project is a
  different timeline, and resolution never leaks across projects;
- initial head semantics: after create, the timeline stream head is 1,
  ``config_version`` equals that head, and the project event head advanced
  by exactly one;
- sorted lists: ``list`` returns exactly the frozen runtime rows
  ``{timeline_id, timeline_ulid, slug, name, is_default}`` ordered by slug;
- exact runtime rows: ``show`` returns the §5.2 load shape with loose
  ``config``, ``registry.assets``, and ``config_version``;
- missing cases: every read raises typed errors and never an empty
  authority-dependent view;
- restart reconstruction solely from event payload and ``settings_json``:
  after a clean close/reopen, aliases and default state are rebuilt from the
  ``timeline.created`` envelope and the repository-owned settings key — the
  frozen DDL has no slug/ULID/default columns (SD1) and no filesystem
  timeline authority exists;
- whole-document CAS save (plan step 14): a successful save atomically
  updates the document and registry projections, appends one hash-chained
  ``timeline.saved`` event carrying the command delta, advances both heads,
  and records the complete receipt, and reload returns exactly the saved
  load shape;
- save replay and mismatch: an identical retry replays the stored result
  with zero new rows, a changed payload never replays a previous result
  (it surfaces as the typed version conflict or a fresh save), and a
  receipt whose stored hash disagrees with the derived key is rejected by
  the receipt gate before any mutation;
- stale-head and validation failure atomicity: a stale expected head
  raises :class:`TimelineVersionConflictError` carrying the typed current
  version, boolean/non-integer ``expected_version`` and every malformed
  payload are rejected, and each failed save leaves the document, registry,
  events, both heads, and receipts unchanged;
- save project isolation: saving one project's timeline never mutates
  another project's document, registry, events, heads, or receipts, and a
  foreign timeline id is not an address outside its project.

Every command runs inside the caller's one ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` unit of work
(:class:`astrid.core.store.uow.UnitOfWork`); every read runs on a separate
read-only connection.
