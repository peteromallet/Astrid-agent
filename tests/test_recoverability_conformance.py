"""Recoverability conformance scanner — final zero mode.

The scanner enforces that every user-facing parser surface uses the shared
recoverability contracts:

* ``--kind`` arguments must use ``add_kind_arg()`` (``kind_arg_findings``)
* Enum-choice arguments must use ``RegistryChoices`` or ``StaticChoices``
  (``non_kind_enum_findings``)
* No user-facing bare ``ValueError`` / ``RuntimeError`` raises
  (``ast_findings`` → ``bare_raise``)
* No bespoke user-facing ``sys.stderr`` renderers
  (``ast_findings`` → ``direct_stderr``)
* Every expected parser surface must be importable and scannable
  (``skipped_parser_surface_count`` → 0)

The allowlists (``ALLOWED_BARE_RAISES`` / ``ALLOWED_STDERR_SITES``) are
the only mechanism for exempting a finding — every exempted site must
carry an explicit reason so reviewers can audit it.

The single test ``test_recoverability_conformance_zero_mode`` runs the
scanner live and asserts zero findings across all categories.  Any
non-zero finding causes a test failure with a detailed breakdown.

Import safety
-------------
This module imports only stdlib packages at module level.  The scanner
script (``_PARSER_SURFACE_SCRIPT``) is executed in isolated subprocesses
so import failures there are recorded as skipped surfaces, not module-level
crashes.  The module is safe to import even when optional dependencies are
absent.
