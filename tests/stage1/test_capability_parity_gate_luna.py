"""Machine-readable Stage 1 capability census and adapter-family gate.

The Stage 1 contract requires an explicit disposition for every discovered
capability.  It does not require 59 copies of the host protocol test: the
generic host is deliberately shared by adapter families.  This gate therefore
records the family representative that proves the shared route, while keeping
the canonical Remotion compositor as a direct-proof exception whenever it is
actually ready.

The resulting report is written to ``tmp_path`` by the test so CI can retain it
without making generated evidence part of the source checkout.
