"""A queued task that cannot run must not stop the host claiming other work.

Incident (9 Oct): a chiptune.compose task admitted against the capability
digest a promote had just replaced sat first in the Runtime queue. The Runtime
offers only the oldest queued task, so every claim came back "waiting" and the
pack host claimed nothing (VO, cutouts, visualize) for 25 minutes, logging
nothing. Admission must also stay cheap while retained attempt roots exist.
