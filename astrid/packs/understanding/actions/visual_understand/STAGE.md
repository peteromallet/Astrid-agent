# Visual Understand

Wraps OpenAI's `/v1/responses` vision API. Pass an image (or a video plus
`--at` timestamps) plus a free-text `--query` and get the model's answer.

## Modes

**Free-text (default):**
```python
import astrid.sdk as sdk
result = sdk.invoke(
    "understanding.visual_understand",
        kind="executor", project="demo",
    inputs={"image": "path/to.jpg", "query": "Describe this scene in one sentence."},
)
```

**Structured-output (schema-constrained):** pass `response_schema` to
force the model's reply to be JSON validating against your schema. Uses the
OpenAI Responses API `text.format = json_schema` (strict mode).

```python
import astrid.sdk as sdk
result = sdk.invoke(
    "understanding.visual_understand",
        kind="executor", project="demo",
    inputs={
        "image": "path/to.jpg",
        "query": "Classify into one bucket from this list.",
        "response_schema": "my_schema.json",
    },
)
```

Schema file may be either the raw JSON schema or an object of the form
`{ "name": "<id>", "schema": {...}, "strict": true }`. If you pass the raw
schema, the name defaults to `"response"` and strict defaults to true.

## Ordered multi-image evidence API

Evaluation gates that must preserve original page resolution and order use the
additive Python API in `visual_understand.run`:

```python
evidence = understand_ordered(
    ordered_png_paths,
    prompt=reading_guide,
    model="gpt-5.6-sol",  # explicit provider id; aliases are rejected
    settings={"detail": "high", "max_output_tokens": 700, "cost_ceiling": 12},
    structured=answer_schema,
)
artifact_path.write_bytes(evidence.to_json_bytes())
```

This sends one Responses API request with one `input_image` block per source
file, in caller order. It never enters the crop/contact-sheet pipeline. The
returned `OrderedImageEvidence` contains the exact paths and byte hashes,
prompt hash, resolved settings and ceiling, requested and returned model ids,
response id, usage, and client-validated answers. Its canonical JSON excludes
wall-clock metadata and is suitable for an ignorable run artifact.

## Use cases

- **VLM bucket-judge / caption with locked vocab.** Generate a schema whose
  fields are enums over your vocabulary file; the model can't emit
  out-of-vocab tokens. This is how dataset-build configs can enforce
  caption-template adherence without a project-specific VLM wrapper.
- **One-off image questions.** Skip `response_schema` and use the free-text
  mode.
- **Crop / contact-sheet contact.** See `crop_aspect`, `cols`, etc.

## Models

Pass `mode: "fast"` (gpt-4o-mini, default, cheap) or `mode: "best"` (gpt-5.4, full
detail). Pass `compare_model: <id>` to fan out the same query across
multiple models.

## Frames from video

```python
import astrid.sdk as sdk
result = sdk.invoke(
    "understanding.visual_understand",
        kind="executor", project="demo",
    inputs={"video": "clip.mp4", "query": "What's happening at these moments?", "at": "0:05,0:12,0:20"},
)
```

Run the `editorial.boundary_candidates` executor first (through `astrid.sdk.invoke`) if you need help picking timestamps.
