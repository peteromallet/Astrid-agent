"""Runaway schema pack (in-tree, explicitly registered).

The runaway pack owns the ``runaway_transitions`` table plus the namespaced
``runaway.*`` command vocabulary declared in ``schema-pack.yaml`` next to
this module. The table FK-integrates with the kernel run table
(``runs.id`` RESTRICT, ``projects.id`` CASCADE, ``tasks.id`` SET NULL) and
handles sharding for >256 transitions via ``continue_run`` (ordinal
contiguous globally, ``run_id`` per shard).

This package marker stays minimal: the composed registry and migration
runner consume the manifest file, and startup registers this pack through
the single explicit ``register_pack()`` path — never through discovery or
the capability-pack loader.
