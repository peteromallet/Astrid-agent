"""Timeline repository: create, address resolution, list, and show (m1 plan step 13).

The timeline pack's first complete repository vertical lives in this module
(``astrid/packs/timeline/repository.py``). It mirrors the kernel project
vertical's shape — one writer transaction per command, typed errors, frozen
read models, transaction-free reads — while honoring the frozen v10 DDL
(SD1): the ``timelines`` table has **no** slug, ULID, or default columns.

:meth:`TimelineRepository.create` is one complete command inside the caller's
single ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` unit of work:

1. validates the immutable slug grammar and the loose config/registry shapes;
2. runs the receipt idempotency gate (stable-ID replay or mismatch-before-
   mutation, exactly like project create);
3. enforces **alias uniqueness under ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``** — the slug and
   lowercase ULID live only inside ``timeline.created`` event envelopes, so
   uniqueness is a transactional query over the project's created events,
   never a convenience column;
4. inserts the ``timeline.timeline`` event stream and the whole-document
   ``timelines`` projection, appends the hash-chained ``timeline.created``
   event (canonical SD2 envelope), optionally sets the repository-owned
   default timeline id in ``projects.settings_json`` through
   :meth:`ProjectRepository.set_default_timeline` (the only writer of that
   key), and records the complete receipt — all atomically.

Reads (:meth:`resolve`, :meth:`list`, :meth:`show`) are transaction-free
queries on a separate read-only connection (the established T14/T15 path).
``resolve`` resolves a canonical UUID, lowercase 26-character Crockford ULID,
or immutable project-scoped slug **within one project** (runtime §8 order:
UUID, then ULID, then slug). ``list`` returns frozen runtime-shaped rows
``{timeline_id, timeline_ulid, slug, name, is_default}`` sorted by slug, and
``show`` returns the frozen load shape with loose ``config``,
``registry.assets``, and ``config_version`` equal to the numeric timeline
stream head. Default-timeline state is projected from
``projects.settings_json`` only — never a second authority.

:meth:`TimelineRepository.save` (plan step 14) is the whole-document CAS
command: it canonicalizes only the frozen runtime top keys, derives the
internal idempotency key from project/timeline identity, the integer
expected head, and the canonical payload, CAS-checks the expected head
*before* any mutation (a stale save raises
:class:`TimelineVersionConflictError` carrying the current head and changes
zero rows), and atomically updates ``document_json`` +
``asset_registry_json``, appends one ``timeline.saved`` event, advances
both heads, and records the receipt — returning the committed load shape
with the new ``config_version``.

        ``timeline.saved`` event carrying the command delta is appended
        (advancing stream and project heads), and the complete receipt is
        written. Returns the frozen load shape (§5.2) with the new
