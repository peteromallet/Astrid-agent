# VibeComfy — the escape hatch

For standard image generation use the `generate-image` skill.  Reach for this
skill when you need LoRAs, IP-adapter, controlnet, custom samplers, graph
composition, or any path the registry doesn't cover.

`vibecomfy.run` is the **escape hatch** for generation features that fall
outside the basic happy-path contracts of `generation.generate_image` and
`generation.generate_video` (and the planned audio executor).  Use it directly for:

- **LoRAs** — attach custom weights to any node in the ComfyUI graph.
- **IP-adapter** — image-prompt / style-reference conditioning.
- **ControlNet** — depth, canny, pose, scribble, and other structural conditioning.
- **Custom samplers** — DPM++ 3M, UniPC, LCM, etc.
- **Exotic conditioning** — regional prompting, attention injection, CFG
  scheduling, and any other node-graph surgery not covered by the opinionated
  `generation.generate_image` contract.

The builtin image executor supports six canonical modes (`t2i`, `i2i`, `edit`,
`inpaint`, `outpaint`, `upscale`) across a growing Tier-1 model list.  Everything
beyond those modes — LoRAs, IP-adapter, ControlNet, custom samplers — belongs here.

## How to use

- `vibecomfy.run` maps to `python -m vibecomfy.cli run {workflow}`
- `vibecomfy.validate` maps to `python -m vibecomfy.cli validate {workflow}`

Install the executor packages before running these actions. Both executors
share the `vibecomfy` package environment via the folder-level `PACKAGE_ID`.
