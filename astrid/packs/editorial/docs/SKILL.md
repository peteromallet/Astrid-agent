  Editorial pack: the 14-step hype video pipeline from transcribe through
  validate, plus auxiliary tools for human-in-the-loop review, notes
  ingestion, cut inspection, boundary review, and script generation.
  Cross-pack steps include scene_describe (understanding), pool_build and
  pool_merge (training), cut (video_editing), and render (rendering).

# Editorial

The editorial pack is the backbone of Astrid's video creation pipeline.
It runs the full 14-step progression from raw source media to a validated
rendered video, with cross-pack handoffs to understanding, training,
video_editing, and rendering.

## Pipeline stage order

The numbered pipeline runs steps 0 through 14. Steps from other packs are
shown with their owning pack in parentheses — they are not part of the
editorial pack but are essential to the pipeline flow.

| Step | Stage | Pack | Sentinel / Output | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | transcribe | editorial | `transcript.json` | Transcribe source audio to text via Whisper. |
| 1 | scenes | editorial | `scenes.json`, `scene_items.json` | Detect scene boundaries with ffmpeg-driven analysis. |
| 2 | quality_zones | editorial | `quality_zones.json` | Tag arrangement clips with per-zone quality grades. |
| 3 | shots | editorial | `shots.json` | Slice scenes into shot windows for pool building. |
| 4 | triage | editorial | `scene_triage.json` | Triage scenes by quality — gate before pool building. |
| 5 | scene_describe | understanding | `scene_descriptions.json` | Caption each scene with a vision model (OpenAI). |
| 5.5 | video_understand | understanding | — | Synchronized audio+video window inspection. Optional, interleaved between scene_describe and quote_scout. |
| 6 | quote_scout | editorial | `quote_candidates.json` | Scan transcript for quotable lines suitable for hype clips. |
| 7 | pool_build | training | `pool.json` | Build the candidate clip pool from triaged scenes. |
| 8 | pool_merge | training | `pool.json` (mutated) | Merge multiple pools into a unified pool for arrangement. |
| 9 | arrange | editorial | `arrangement.json` | Compose a brief-specific shot arrangement from the pool via LLM. |
| 10 | cut | video_editing | `hype.timeline.json`, `hype.assets.json`, `hype.metadata.json` | Assemble arrangement into the timeline+assets+metadata JSON triple for Remotion. |
| 11 | refine | editorial | `refine.json` + mutated triple | Apply targeted reviewer-driven refinements to the arrangement. |
| 12 | render | rendering | `hype.mp4` | Render the timeline to video through the Remotion compositor. |
| 13 | editor_review | editorial | `editor_review.json` | Run heuristic editorial reviewers over the rendered video. Human-in-the-loop gate. |
| 14 | validate | editorial | `validation.json` | Validate rendered video against timeline and metadata (Whisper + schema). |

## Auxiliary tools (outside numbered pipeline)

These actions are not part of the numbered 0–14 pipeline. They have no
`pipeline_step_order` in their action.yaml and operate standalone.

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `editorial.human_notes` | Convert free-text human editorial notes into structured `editor_review.json` for the pipeline. Optional `--apply` chains a full revise cycle. |
| `editorial.inspect_cut` | Debugging tool: inspect a cut run directory and print a script/structure/clip text report. Supports `--json` and `--clip` flags. Called internally by `editor_review`. |
| `editorial.human_review` | Generic human-gate primitive. Serves an HTML page on localhost, collects human decisions as JSON, blocks until submit. Token-authenticated POSTs. |
| `editorial.boundary_candidates` | Package candidate video frames for visual scene-boundary review. |
| `editorial.script_pipeline` | Preset-driven creative-writing pipeline: generates short scripts through rough attempts, synthesis, style pass, and optional judging. |

## When to use

- Use `editorial.transcribe` through `editorial.validate` in pipeline
  order when running the full hype video workflow. The hype orchestrator
  (`video_editing.hype`) sequences these automatically.
- Run individual editorial actions standalone when you need to re-run
  a specific stage (e.g., re-transcribe with different settings, re-triage
  with adjusted quality thresholds).
- Use `editorial.human_notes` when you have free-text feedback and want
  it converted to structured pipeline inputs.
- Use `editorial.inspect_cut` for debugging a cut run directory — it
  prints a human-readable report of the timeline, assets, and clips.
- Use `editorial.human_review` as a generic human-in-the-loop gate for
  any review workflow (dataset review, eval-grid pick, arrangement
  approval).
- Use `editorial.boundary_candidates` when you want to visually review
  scene boundaries before committing to cuts.
- Use `editorial.script_pipeline` when you need AI-generated creative
  scripts from a preset or prompt.
