# Video Editing

The video_editing pack covers seven orchestrators and one executor that
together form the video creation and editing surface of Astrid.

## Orchestrator decision tree

| Use case | Orchestrator | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Full hype video pipeline (transcribe → render) | `video_editing.hype` | End-to-end pipeline: transcribe source, detect scenes, build clip pool, arrange shots, cut timeline, render video. The default entry point for hype videos. |
| Event talk videos (templated talks + render) | `video_editing.event_talks` | Build event talk videos from a template, search transcripts, find holding screens, and render via local ffmpeg/Remotion. |
| Thumbnail generation from video + query | `video_editing.thumbnail_maker` | Generate a set of thumbnail candidates from a source video and a text query. Plans evidence needs, discovers source frames, and renders a grid of candidates. |
| Iteration video compilation | `video_editing.iteration_video` | Read selected runtime project runs, assemble render adapter files, render through rendering.render, and finalize iteration video outputs. |
| Logo concept grid generation | `video_editing.logo_ideas` | Generate a grid of distinct logo concepts: Kimi K2 drafts prompts, then GPT Image 2 renders a composite grid (or per-image renders with `--provider z-image`). |
| Image-to-video animation | `video_editing.animate_image` | Two-stage pipeline: generate a still image via fal GPT Image 2 edit, then animate it with fal WAN 2.2 animate/move driven by a reference video. |
| Grid-based variation editing | `video_editing.vary_grid` | Iterative grid editor: take an existing grid image, pick reference cells, generate a new grid of variations via fal GPT Image 2 edit. |

## Executors

| Executor | What it does |
|---|---|
| `video_editing.cut` | Assembles an arrangement into a timeline+assets+metadata JSON triple for Remotion. Pipeline step 10 — bridges editorial arrangement to rendering. |

The `cut` executor is the timeline-assembly stage that sits between
editorial arrangement (step 9) and rendering (step 12). It consumes
`arrangement.json`, the unified clip pool, the creative brief, and an
optional theme, then produces `hype.timeline.json`, `hype.assets.json`,
and `hype.metadata.json` — the three-file input to rendering.render.

For edits to an existing runtime-owned timeline, route through the
existing-timeline path in this skill. The rendering pack is downstream evidence
for that path; it does not replace the editorial route. The orchestrators and
`cut` executor remain for their stated creation/assembly workflows; do not
invent a second timeline editing path here.

## Existing timeline editing

This is the primary agent-facing route for an already-created Runtime
timeline: **inspect → edit → validate → save**. Use the same identity and time
window in any views you choose:

1. **Open and pin** the explicit project/timeline and current authoring head.
2. **Inspect the exact target** in the structural/text view, expanding the
   occurrence, clip, track, property, and source handle only as needed.
3. **Choose the evidence view**: text for roles, ownership, and exact values;
   visual/input inspection for placement; rendered visual inspection only when
   pixels are needed.
4. **Edit a detached candidate** opened from that pinned parent/shot/internal
   closure. Use the smallest supported primitive or ordinary Python against the
   same-schema candidate; never mutate the checkout or canonical source.
5. **Validate and diff** the complete candidate against the requested edit and
   preserved fields.
6. **Save** through the compare-and-swap/idempotent publication boundary and
   retain its receipt. Iterate and save again as needed. Reopening the returned
   committed closure is an optional check, not a required step for every edit.

Rendering and visualization are optional unless explicitly requested or
needed to establish an output claim. For “show me the preview, then save”
(including the A01 replacement brief), render the unpublished candidate,
inspect/deliver its output, then publish that same candidate. A JSON freeze is
not a visual preview; a failed required preview leaves the candidate unsaved.
Do not replace this ordering with a render after publication. Other edits may
save without rendering. Report saved changes and any unavailable visual/audio
verification accurately.

In the detached bundle, `work["placements"]` contains occurrence rows: select
the returned `occurrence_id`, then edit `row["placement"]["start_ms"]` or
`row["placement"]["duration_ms"]`. Identity fields such as `shot_id` remain on
the row. Child clips live in `work["shots"][shot_id]["internal_timeline"]`;
shot payload fields live in `work["shots"][shot_id]["payload"]`. Preserve the
returned schema instead of adding flat timing fields or editing derived
`parent.occurrences`.

### Native timeline discovery and visual inspection

For read-only discovery, the connected Runtime is the authority. Use
`timelines show` for bounded structural/text facts and
`timelines visualize --mode inputs` for the Runtime-owned
declared-input view. These are sibling native Runtime operations over the same
project, timeline, head, and occurrence identity; the input view does not
decode source pixels or render a final video. Use the exact returned
`occurrence_id` when moving between the two calls. Shot names, list positions,
and fixture aliases are display conveniences, not substitutes for occurrence
identity.

Use the single `timelines visualize` operation for visual inspection. Its
default `auto` mode shows declared inputs and includes composed output only when
a fresh matching render already exists; it never starts a render. Use
`--mode inputs` for a render-free declared-input view. To inspect composed
pixels or sound, render the exact saved state or candidate, then pass the
returned run with `--mode composed --render-run <ID>`. A supplied run shows
that run's state, which may be historical or a candidate preview. Read facts
from live Runtime responses and returned artifacts, never fixture/evaluator
JSON, seed maps, or prior result files.

```bash
python3 -m astrid timelines show --project <project> <timeline> --json
python3 -m astrid timelines visualize <timeline> --project <project> \
  --mode inputs --format md --format png --occurrence <occurrence-id> --json
```

Checkout source path: `astrid/packs/video_editing/skill/SKILL.md`.
Installed/public skill-view path: `packs/video_editing/SKILL.md` (the public
timeline package also carries the downstream compatibility skill at
`packs/rendering/SKILL.md`). Relative links in either view must resolve within
that view; do not treat a checkout path as an installed path.

For optional render, filmstrip, and playback evidence,
see the [rendering compatibility skill](../../rendering/skill/SKILL.md).
For a supplied target and credential, see the executable
[target-bound SDK edit example](../../../../docs/timeline-editing-guide.md).

For source access, use returned managed media/object identities, not a clip's
timeline-local `asset` alias. An artifact handle is also distinct from a local
path or a host reader's numeric artifact ID. Follow the returned opening action
or verified local path; if unavailable, report the gap. The linked guide
describes the current response envelopes and source-byte route. Keep SDK work
in the connected shell environment or pass the supplied connection explicitly;
a persistent evaluator does not necessarily inherit that shell's connection.

## When to use

- Use `video_editing.hype` for the full end-to-end hype video pipeline.
  This is the canonical orchestrator for turning source media into a
  finished video.
- Use `video_editing.event_talks` when you have event talk content and
  want templated video output with transcript search and holding screens.
- Use `video_editing.thumbnail_maker` when you need thumbnail candidates
  for a video — provides a query-driven planning and generation flow.
- Use `video_editing.iteration_video` for compiling selected runtime-project
  runs into a video summary. It does not read thread indexes or run.json files.
- Use `video_editing.logo_ideas` for quick logo concept exploration via
  LLM prompt drafting and image generation.
- Use `video_editing.animate_image` to turn a still image into an
  animated video driven by motion from a reference clip.
- Use `video_editing.vary_grid` for iterative grid-based image variation
  and editing.
- Use `video_editing.cut` standalone when you have an arrangement and
  pool ready and only need the timeline assembly step.

## Quick-start

```python
# Full hype pipeline (orchestrator)
import astrid.sdk as sdk
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.hype",
    inputs={"video": "./source.mp4", "brief": "./briefs/my-hype.md", "theme": "./themes/default.json"},
    out="./runs/my-run",
)

# Thumbnail candidates
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.thumbnail_maker",
    inputs={"video": "./source.mp4", "query": "epic moment"},
    out="./thumbs",
)

# Logo concept grid
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.logo_ideas",
    inputs={"prompt": "a bold tech startup logo"},
    out="./logos",
)

# Animate an image with a reference video
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.animate_image",
    inputs={"image": "./still.png", "reference_video": "./motion.mp4"},
    out="./animated",
)

# Grid variation editing
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.vary_grid",
    inputs={"grid": "./grid.png", "cells": "0,3"},
    out="./variations",
)

# Cut (executor) — assemble timeline from arrangement
result = sdk.invoke(
    "video_editing.cut",
    inputs={
        "arrangement": "./out/arrangement.json",
        "pool": "./out/unified_pool.json",
        "brief": "./briefs/my-hype.md",
    },
    out="./out",
)
```

Event talk videos run their step subcommands through the orchestrator module:

```bash
python3 -m astrid.packs.video_editing.orchestrators.event_talks.run \
  ados-sunday-template --out ./talk-output
```
