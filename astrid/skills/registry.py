"""Auto-managed pack registry in the creative-work supporting reference.

``astrid skills sync`` keeps a sentinel-delimited block in the creative-work reference
current: one terse row per discovered pack skill, with the pack's
``short_description`` and an inward pointer to where its full skill lives. The
block is regenerated deterministically from :func:`astrid.skills.discovery.list_skills`
— the same discovery the install/sync machinery uses — so the registry never
drifts from the skills that are actually linkable.

Everything outside the sentinel markers is preserved byte-for-byte. When the
markers are absent the block is inserted under a new ``## Installed packs``
heading just after the intro paragraph.
