"""Shared internal helpers for timeline edit modules.

Extracted from ``clip_edits.py`` to avoid duplication across the active
secondary domain edit modules (transition_edits, effect_edits, theme_edits,
track_edits, audio_edits).

Every public mutation function in the edit modules uses:

* ``_resolve_or_bootstrap_backend`` — locate the timeline, then resolve the
  event-log backend.  Handles two cases:
  1. Identity exists with provenance ``"created"`` → resolve backend normally,
     first domain event is bare (no ``timeline.imported``).
  2. Identity missing → fail closed. Legacy conversion is handled only by the
     Sprint 2 migration scripts.
* ``_materialize`` — post-append projection regenerator that calls
  ``regenerate_projection()`` to rewrite ``assembly.json`` from the
  canonical event stream.
* ``_default_actor`` — sensible system actor for editing operations
* ``TimelineEditError`` — shared exception base caught by the CLI handler

Pack / worker write paths use:

* ``pack_write_gateway`` — centralized append-then-regenerate gateway that
  accepts a managed binding tuple, resolves an identity-backed backend,
  appends events in a batch, regenerates ``assembly.json`` once from the
  canonical event stream, and returns a
  normalised ``PackWriteResult``. Batch-level CAS, soft-lock enforcement,
  and explicit transaction orchestration are intentionally deferred in m5.
* ``PackWriteResult`` — dataclass carrying new_version, event_ids, attempts,
  backend_name, timeline_ulid, timeline_slug, timeline_event_stream_id,
  and timeline_home.

    appends every event, materializes compatibility outputs synchronously, and returns a
    normalised ``PackWriteResult``.

    Scope note
    ----------
    This helper remains a simple append loop in m5. It does not yet provide
    a pack-level ``expected_version`` / CAS boundary across the whole batch,
    soft-lock checks, or explicit transaction APIs; those require semantics
    beyond the per-event eventlog contract and are intentionally deferred.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_slug:
        Project that owns the timeline.
    timeline_slug:
        Validated timeline slug.
    timeline_ulid:
        26-char Crockford ULID of the timeline container.
    timeline_event_stream_id:
        UUID from the timeline identity sidecar (the ``timeline_id`` used
        by backend append operations).
    events:
        List of event dicts, each with keys ``"kind"`` (str) and
        ``"payload"`` (dict).  Appended in order.
    actor:
        Fully constructed ``TimelineActor``.  Takes precedence over
        ``actor_id`` / ``actor_type`` / ``actor_display`` / ``actor_via``.
    actor_id:
        Actor identifier when *actor* is not supplied.  Defaults to
        ``"pack-gateway:<timeline_ulid>"``.
    actor_type:
        One of ``"system"``, ``"agent"``, ``"human"``.  Default ``"system"``.
    actor_display:
        Human-readable display name for the actor.
    actor_via:
        When set, the outer actor represents the proximate writer and
        *actor_via* is chained as ``actor.via`` — preserving upstream
        provenance (e.g. the human or agent that launched the pack).
    root:
        Project root override.
    writer:
        Optional kernel :class:`~astrid.core.store.writer.DatabaseWriter`.
        When supplied, every ``timeline.config_replaced`` event is
        additionally committed to the **kernel timeline store** through
        :meth:`astrid.packs.timeline.repository.TimelineRepository.replace_config`
        (the declared ``timeline.replace_config`` command) inside one
        ``UnitOfWork(writer)`` per event, with receipt key
        ``timeline.replace_config:{timeline_id}:{expected_version}`` —
        committed **before** the eventlog append (fail-closed: no eventlog
        event without its kernel receipt). The kernel commit itself runs
        only after the identity-backed eventlog backend has been resolved
        and validated, so a backend failure raises with zero mutation on
        either side. When omitted (packs running
        without kernel access), the gateway keeps its eventlog-only
        behavior and no kernel receipt is written.

    Returns
    -------
    PackWriteResult
        Normalised result carrying the version after appends, event ids,
        backend name, timeline identifiers, and the timeline home path.

    Raises
    ------
    TimelineEditError
        When the backend cannot be resolved or an append fails.
    EventVocabularyError
        When any event kind is not declared by the composed standard
        registry (raised before any backend or append work).
