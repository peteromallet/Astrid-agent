"""Shared internal helpers for timeline edit modules.

Extracted from ``clip_edits.py`` to avoid duplication across the active
secondary domain edit modules (transition_edits, effect_edits, theme_edits,
track_edits, audio_edits).

Every public mutation function in the edit modules uses:

* ``_resolve_or_bootstrap_backend`` — locate the timeline, then resolve the
  event-log backend.  Handles two cases:
  1. Identity exists with provenance ``"created"`` → resolve backend normally,
     first domain event is bare.
  2. Identity missing → fail closed. Callers must create a runtime timeline
     before editing.
* ``_materialize`` — post-append projection regenerator that calls
  ``regenerate_projection()`` to rewrite ``assembly.json`` from the
  canonical event stream.
* ``_default_actor`` — sensible system actor for editing operations
* ``TimelineEditError`` — shared exception base caught by the CLI handler

Pack / worker write paths use:

* ``pack_write_gateway`` — centralized append-then-regenerate gateway that
  accepts a managed binding tuple, resolves an identity-backed backend,
  appends events in a batch, regenerates ``assembly.json`` once from the
  canonical event stream, and returns a
  normalised ``PackWriteResult``. Batch-level CAS, soft-lock enforcement,
  and explicit transaction orchestration are intentionally deferred in m5.
* ``PackWriteResult`` — dataclass carrying new_version, event_ids, attempts,
  backend_name, timeline_ulid, timeline_slug, timeline_event_stream_id,
  and timeline_home.

    normalised ``PackWriteResult``.

    Scope note
    ----------
    This helper remains a simple append loop in m5. It does not yet provide
    a pack-level ``expected_version`` / CAS boundary across the whole batch,
    soft-lock checks, or explicit transaction APIs; those require semantics
    beyond the per-event eventlog contract and are intentionally deferred.

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_slug:
        Project that owns the timeline.
    timeline_slug:
        Validated timeline slug.
    timeline_ulid:
        26-char Crockford ULID of the timeline container.
    timeline_event_stream_id:
        UUID from the timeline identity sidecar (the ``timeline_id`` used
        by backend append operations).
    events:
        List of event dicts, each with keys ``"kind"`` (str) and
        ``"payload"`` (dict).  Appended in order.
    actor:
        Fully constructed ``TimelineActor``.  Takes precedence over
        ``actor_id`` / ``actor_type`` / ``actor_display`` / ``actor_via``.
    actor_id:
        Actor identifier when *actor* is not supplied.  Defaults to
        ``"pack-gateway:<timeline_ulid>"``.
    actor_type:
        One of ``"system"``, ``"agent"``, ``"human"``.  Default ``"system"``.
    actor_display:
        Human-readable display name for the actor.
    actor_via:
        When set, the outer actor represents the proximate writer and
        *actor_via* is chained as ``actor.via`` — preserving upstream
        provenance (e.g. the human or agent that launched the pack).
    root:
        Project root override.

    Returns
    -------
    PackWriteResult
        Normalised result carrying the version after appends, event ids,
        backend name, timeline identifiers, and the timeline home path.

    Raises
    ------

        When the backend cannot be resolved or an append fails.
