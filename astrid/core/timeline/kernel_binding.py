"""Explicit kernel timeline binding for managed pack/worker writers.

The SDK and pack processes are clients of the workspace runtime. They must
not compose a local application merely to discover a kernel writer. A caller
that already owns an attempt-local writer/repository may pass those handles
through the binding seam; otherwise the write gateway remains eventlog-only and
the runtime owns canonical timeline mutations.
