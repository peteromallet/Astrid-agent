"""Astrid top-level command gateway.

The gateway dispatches to the five product families (``projects``,
``timelines``, ``media``, ``tasks``, ``runs``), the three operational families
(``doctor``, ``backup``, ``dev``), and installed external pack tools. ``--help``/``-h``
and ``help`` print documentation (help is documentation and never requires a
session); ``--version`` prints the version. Everything else is dispatched to
a core family or a discovered pack route.

The settled unbound allowlist is recorded in
``SPRINT1_UNBOUND_ALLOWLIST_CONTRACT`` below: ``doctor``, ``backup`` and
``dev`` are operational families that must run before any project is selected,
and ``help``/``--version`` are documentation.
