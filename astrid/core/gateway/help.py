"""Entrypoint help rendering for the Astrid gateway.

Extracted from ``astrid/gateway.py`` during M4 batch 41 (T42) to keep the
gateway facade focused while preserving the help-printing entrypoint that
callers rely on via ``astrid.core.gateway._print_entrypoint_help``.

``_product_help_text`` / ``_print_product_help`` (m4 plan step 24, task
T26) are the executable help. They document the nine-family core surface
plus discovered external pack routes: the
seven product families from the explicit registry
(``astrid/core/cli/domain_product.py``) with their kernel/pack ownership,
the two manifest-declared nested mounts, the ``--json`` envelope
convention, the stable exit codes, and the two operational families
(``doctor``, ``backup``).

The canonical Python boundary is ``import astrid`` (see docs/reference/sdk.md).
This gateway is the CLI entry point for the seven product families, setup,
workspace status, operational families (doctor, backup), and external tools.

Usage:
  python3 -m astrid <family> <command> [options]
  python3 -m astrid help

Product families:
  python3 -m astrid projects ...
  python3 -m astrid timelines ...
  python3 -m astrid media ...

  python3 -m astrid runs ...

Timeline evidence:
  python3 -m astrid timelines visualize --project PROJECT [--timeline-slug REF]
      [--format FORMAT[,FORMAT...]] [--json]
      (paired rendered filmstrip; use --range/--at/--shot to focus)

Latest project render:
  python3 -m astrid runs open [RUN_ID] [--project PROJECT] [--json]

Operational families:
  python3 -m astrid setup [--input FILE | --create | --attach] [--apply]

External tools:
  python3 -m astrid hivemind search QUERY [--limit N] [--json]

Notes:
  python3 -m astrid is the package entry point.
  Use ``python3 -m astrid help`` for the full family census, kernel/pack
  ownership, nested mounts, and stable exit codes.

Ownership handoff:
  Product commands connect to the selected runtime through the generated
