"""Kernel execution service: injected local handlers outside SQLite (T16).

The service turns one fenced, started attempt into verified prepared media
descriptors — or routes the failure through the repository — without ever
opening its own writer or transaction and without importing packs or remote
execution paths:

1. **Start + staging record (short caller UoW).** The attempt is started
   through :meth:`TaskRepository.start` (receipt-protected, version-fenced)
   and the assigned per-transaction staging id is recorded under the
   reserved ``progress_json`` key :data:`STAGING_TXN_ID_KEY` in the same
   transaction, so startup staging GC preserves the quarantine of every
   live attempt (m2 plan step 3/4). This is runtime state only — like
   heartbeat, it carries no event and no receipt.

2. **Handler execution (outside SQLite).** No transaction is open while the
   injected :class:`TaskHandler` writes files under the assigned staging
   directory and returns a universal result manifest.

3. **Strict manifest validation.** The manifest is validated by
   :func:`astrid.core._shared.result_manifest.validate_result_manifest`
   (T15): concrete contained files, exact byte SHA-256 hashes, unique
   ordinals, at most one primary.

4. **Media descriptors.** Every validated output is prepared into an
   immutable :class:`~astrid.core.io.media_import.PreparedMedia` record
   (hashing/probing outside any transaction), ready for the completion
   command (plan step 10) to materialize.

5. **Failure routing.** Any handler, manifest, or preparation failure is
   routed through :meth:`TaskRepository.fail` (receipt-protected, fenced on
   the post-start status version) with a bounded error payload, and the
   service returns the typed :class:`ExecutionResult` — it never raises for
   handler errors and never writes semantic state itself.

6. **Fenced completion (plan step 10).** :meth:`ExecutionService.complete`
   passes the prepared outputs of :meth:`execute` into the repository's
   fenced completion command inside the caller's UoW, enforcing exactly one
   primary and ordered roles before the command runs, and returns the typed
   :class:`CompletionResult`: ``\"completed\"`` with the full stored
   :class:`~astrid.core.repositories.tasks.TaskCompleteReadModel` (exact
   replay included), or ``\"stale\"`` / ``\"losing\"`` with the typed error
   detail and zero semantic rows when the completion lost a fence or the
   single-winner race.

The caller owns the unit of work and the writer; the service only submits
short repository operations through them (single-writer architecture).
