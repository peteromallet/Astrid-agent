"""Dedicated single-writer SQLite service with FIFO submission.

(m1 plan step 6.) One writer thread owns exactly one writable ``sqlite3``
connection opened through :func:`astrid.core.store.database.open_database`.
Repository callers submit short synchronous command callbacks via
:meth:`DatabaseWriter.submit`; the writer thread executes them in FIFO order
and returns the result (or re-raises the callback's exception) to the
submitting caller. The owned connection never escapes the writer thread:
callbacks receive only a :class:`WriterSession` facade with typed query and
execute operations and no path back to the connection object.

Design rules kept here:

- One writer thread, one owned connection, one FIFO queue
  (``queue.Queue``, so submission order is execution order).
- ``submit()`` is synchronous: it blocks until the callback completes and
  surfaces the callback's exception unchanged, except that SQLite busy
  errors (``database is locked`` / ``database table is locked``) are
  translated to the typed :class:`WriterBusyError` so callers never depend
  on driver-specific messages.
- Submissions after :meth:`DatabaseWriter.close` raise the typed
  :class:`WriterShutdownError`.
- :meth:`DatabaseWriter.close` deterministically drains the queue, stops
  the writer thread, and closes the owned connection; the connection is
  touched only by the writer thread, including its final close.
- Read traffic never shares the write connection:
  :meth:`DatabaseWriter.read_only_connection` yields a separate read-only
  connection opened through the nonmutating read-only open path.

This module never imports the capability-pack loader or discovery
machinery and never hands the write connection (or any ``sqlite3``
connection) to callers. Transaction control (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) is
owned by the kernel unit of work (plan step 7), never by writer callers:
the session rejects transaction-control statements with the typed
:class:`TransactionControlError`, and callbacks that submit work from the
writer thread are rejected up front (they would deadlock the FIFO queue).
When a unit of work is active, an opt-in statement observer
(``on_statement`` on the unit of work) is notified after every SQL
statement boundary, including BEGIN IMMEDIATE/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, so tests
can observe the exact transaction shape without any environment switch.

Rows returned by the session are ``sqlite3.Row`` objects (the writer
connection uses ``row_factory = sqlite3.Row``), so callers may address
columns by name or position.
