"""Run repository: one-transaction bounded direct-child fan-out and derived
group operations (m2 plan steps 12 and 13).

:class:`RunRepository.create` is the run vertical's fan-out root: one writer
transaction commits the ``core.run`` event stream and ``runs`` row, then up
to ``FROZEN_MAX_DIRECT_CHILDREN`` (256) direct child ``core.task`` streams and
``tasks`` rows with stable ``run_ordinal`` values, the resolved same-project
acyclic dependency edges, ordered events (the ``core.run.created`` event
first, then each child's ``core.task.created`` event in ordinal order), both
heads, and **one** complete receipt carrying every ordered event id.

Plan step 13 (T22) adds the group surface on top of that fan-out:

- :meth:`RunRepository.derive_progress` derives ordered group progress from
  the child ``tasks`` rows by ``run_ordinal`` — no cursor, no parent task,
  and no persisted mutable progress aggregate (the single shared derivation
  ``derive_run_progress_counts`` in the task repository also backs task
  completion's parent-run recompute);
- :meth:`RunRepository.cancel` is a receipt-protected group cancel that
  drives every eligible queued/blocked/running child to the terminal
  ``cancelled`` state through the **shared task-cancel predicate**
  (:meth:`TaskRepository.cancel`). Running children are cancelled
  cooperatively; a handler already outside SQLite may finish, but its later
  fenced completion cannot publish outputs. Already-terminal children are
  skipped. The command recomputes the run projection, appends
  ``core.run.cancelled``, and records one run-level receipt;
- :meth:`RunRepository.retry` is a receipt-protected group retry that
  restarts all eligible children — or an explicit subset — through the
  **shared task-retry predicate** (:meth:`TaskRepository.retry`) with the
  shared read-only eligibility check (:meth:`TaskRepository.is_retry_eligible`),
  recomputes the run projection, appends ``core.run.retried``, and records
  one run-level receipt;
- :meth:`RunRepository.close` is a receipt-protected **terminal close** for
  runs that own no non-terminal child work (zero-child runs derive
  ``running`` forever — ``total==0`` — and can never terminalize through a
  child transition): it writes the terminal status/``finished_at``, folds
  the declared outcome into ``result_json``, appends ``core.run.closed``,
  and records one run-level receipt, refusing any run that still owns a
  non-terminal child;
- the group commands reject continuation of a terminal run
  (:class:`RunTerminalError`) before any mutation, and ``close`` applies
  the same terminal-run fence.

Contracts kept here (v10 section 5.2; m2 plan steps 12 and 13):

- **Bounded fan-out.** ``children`` with more than 256 entries is rejected
  before any mutation (``RunValidationError``), so a child 257 can never
  consume a sequence or create a row. Ordinary fan-out (no ``evidence``
  entries) keeps the result's ``evidence_ids`` the empty tuple: fan-out
  creates no evidence, no parent task, and no step record (there is no step
  table at all). m3 extends the same command with the ordered ``evidence``
  entries (plan step 4, T5): each entry is recorded through the kernel
  evidence vertical inside the same ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction, one
  ``core.evidence.recorded`` event per entry lands on the run stream (after
  ``core.run.created``) in submission order, and the complete receipt
  returns the ordered evidence ids while zero-task runs (``children=[]``)
  are first-class — the receipt then carries the run id, no task ids, and
  the evidence ids.
- **Stable ordinals.** Each child's ``run_ordinal`` is its index in the
  submitted set (``0..len(children)-1``), backed by the unique
  ``tasks_run_ordinal`` index; the result returns the ordered task ids and
  the ``[first_ordinal, last_ordinal]`` range.
- **Same-project acyclic dependencies.** Children reuse the task repository's
  frozen dependency rules: each child's declared edges are normalized and
  validated (existence, same-project ownership, no self or duplicate edges,
  and cycle detection) against the tasks visible at that child's creation —
  the earlier children of the same fan-out plus pre-existing project tasks.
  Because children are created in ordinal order, a dependency may reference
  any earlier child or any pre-existing task; a reference to a later child
  is a typed ``TaskDependencyError`` (``missing``), which keeps the resolved
  child graph acyclic by construction.
- **Pure continuation validation.** :meth:`RunRepository.validate_continuation_envelope`
  validates the frozen continuation-envelope fields and ordinal/maximum
  rules **without any transaction, run-head CAS allocation, or terminal
  extension logic** — m2 validates but never executes continuation chunks
  (plan step 12 item 4; the continuation boundary).

The repository is stateless apart from the event append and receipt
services; every command must run inside the caller's
:class:`astrid.core.store.uow.UnitOfWork`.

        task membership, same-project media) are enforced by the evidence
        vertical inside the same transaction — so a failing entry rolls the
        whole command back to zero rows. Ordinary fan-out without evidence
        keeps ``evidence_ids`` the empty tuple.

        The frozen ``core.run.continue`` command (m3 plan step 2) extends an
        existing **running** run with at most
        :data:`FROZEN_MAX_DIRECT_CHILDREN` normalized child specs and
        dependency edges under a caller-supplied expected run-stream head
        (CAS). Inside the caller's active unit of work, in one
        ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction:

        1. **Fences before any mutation.** A missing or foreign run raises
           :class:`RunNotFoundError`, a terminal run raises
           :class:`RunTerminalError`, a run whose stream head disagrees with
           *expected_version* raises :class:`RunStaleHeadError`, and a chunk
           whose ordinal range is not exactly contiguous with the run's
           existing children (or would exceed the ``0 .. 255`` bound) raises
           :class:`RunValidationError` — all before any sequence allocation,
           event append, child stream/row insert, or receipt write.
        2. **Continuation event first.** One hash-chained
           ``core.run.continued`` event carrying the CAS-checked expected
           head, the chunk's ordinal range, and the next run-stream version
           is appended on the run stream **before** any child creation event.
        3. **Reused child creation.** Each child is created exactly like
           fan-out: the shared task normalization
           (:func:`_normalize_child`), dependency normalization and graph
           validation (``_normalize_dependencies``/``_validate_dependency_graph``
           in the task repository — a dependency on a later child of this
           chunk or a future chunk is a typed missing-dependency error, and
           a cross-project dependency is a typed cross-project error), the
           initial ``blocked``/``queued`` status, the ``core.task`` stream,
           ``tasks`` row with a stable contiguous ``run_ordinal``, the
           resolved edges, and the ``core.task.created`` event. Earlier
           children of this chunk are visible to later children, so the
           chunk graph stays acyclic by construction.
        4. **One complete receipt.** The replayable receipt carries the
           ordered event ids (continuation event first, then each child
           event), the exact project-sequence range, and the result — task
           ids, ordinal range, and ``next_version`` (the run stream head a
           subsequent continuation must CAS on).

        Idempotency mirrors fan-out: the receipt gate runs first, an
        identical retry under the same key returns exactly the stored
        continuation result with zero new rows, and a changed request under
        the same key raises :class:`ReceiptMismatchError` before any
        mutation.

          handler already outside SQLite may finish, but its later fenced
          completion cannot publish outputs. Already-terminal children
          (``succeeded``/``failed``/``cancelled``) are skipped.
        - **Terminal-run rejection.** A run that already reached
          ``succeeded``/``failed``/``cancelled`` raises
          :class:`RunTerminalError` before any child is touched: terminal
          runs never continue (m2 plan step 13).
        - **Projection.** After the child transitions the run projection is
          recomputed from the child rows (shared derivation): when every
          child is terminal the run transitions to ``failed`` (any child
          failed), ``cancelled`` (any child cancelled, none failed), or
          ``succeeded``, stamping ``finished_at``; otherwise it stays
          ``running``.
        - **One group request id.** The effective ``cancel_request_id``
          (the caller's or a fresh generated one) is shared by every
          cancelled child and recorded on the run event.

        Idempotency: the receipt gate runs first. An identical retry under
        the same key returns exactly the stored group-cancel result with
        zero new rows; a changed request under the same key raises
        :class:`ReceiptMismatchError` before any mutation.

        Inside the caller's active unit of work this restarts the run's
        failed/expired work through the shared task-retry predicate
        (:meth:`TaskRepository.retry` — the same attempt-budget and
        terminal-immutability rules, receipt and event included), in
        ordinal order, then recomputes the run projection, appends the
        hash-chained ``core.run.retried`` event on the run stream, and
        records **one** complete run-level receipt carrying every ordered
        event id.

        - **Retry all eligible.** Without *selected_task_ids* every child
          that satisfies the shared retry eligibility (read through
          :meth:`TaskRepository.is_retry_eligible`, then transitioned by the
          shared predicate) is retried; ineligible children — terminal
          tasks, never-claimed work, running work, blocked work, or
          exhausted attempt budgets — are skipped and reported.
        - **Explicit subset.** With *selected_task_ids* (a non-empty unique
          sequence of direct children of this run) exactly those children
          are retried in ordinal order; an id that is not a direct child
          raises :class:`RunValidationError` before any mutation, and an
          ineligible selected child raises the shared predicate's typed
          :class:`TaskTransitionError` — one transaction, so nothing is
          half-retried. The canonical sorted subset participates in the
          request identity, so retrying a different subset under the same
          key is a mismatch before any mutation.
        - **Terminal-run rejection.** A run that already reached
          ``succeeded``/``failed``/``cancelled`` raises
          :class:`RunTerminalError` before any child is touched: terminal
          runs never continue (m2 plan step 13).
        - **Projection.** After the transitions the run projection is
          recomputed from the child rows (shared derivation): retried
          children are ``running`` again, so the run stays ``running`` with
          refreshed counts.

        Idempotency: the receipt gate runs first. An identical retry under
        the same key returns exactly the stored group-retry result with
        zero new rows; a changed request under the same key raises
        :class:`ReceiptMismatchError` before any mutation.

        Inside the caller's active unit of work this transitions a
        ``running`` run to the caller-declared (or child-derived) terminal
        *outcome*
        (``succeeded``/``failed``/``cancelled``): the ``runs.status`` and
        ``finished_at`` columns are written, the outcome is folded into
        ``runs.result_json`` (every existing projection key preserved,
        ``status`` set to the outcome and ``outcome`` added), one
        hash-chained ``core.run.closed`` event is appended on the run
        stream, and one complete run-level receipt is recorded.

        - **Zero-child runs are first-class.** A run created with
          ``children=[]`` derives ``running`` forever under the shared
          derivation rule (``total==0`` → ``running``), so no child
          transition can ever terminalize it; ``close`` is its terminal
          transition.
        - **Non-terminal children are refused.** A run that still owns a
          queued/blocked/running child raises :class:`RunValidationError`
          before any mutation — that child's work must resolve through its
          own lifecycle transition or a group cancel/retry first. Already
          terminal children are fine (their completion already recomputed
          the projection; a run whose every child is terminal is normally
          already terminal, so the running-CAS below refuses it).
        - **Terminal-run rejection.** A run that already reached
          ``succeeded``/``failed``/``cancelled`` raises
          :class:`RunTerminalError` before any mutation: terminal runs
          never change (SD1).
        - **Projection.** The existing ``result_json`` keys are preserved
          and the outcome is folded in (``status`` and ``outcome``),
          matching the shared projection recompute's key shape where the
          prior projection already carries counts.

        Idempotency: the receipt gate runs first. An identical retry under
        the same key returns exactly the stored close result with zero new
        rows; a changed request under the same key raises
        :class:`ReceiptMismatchError` before any mutation. Callers key
        close receipts on the run identity, e.g.
