"""Product-family CLI registry (m4 plan step 24, task T25).

This module is the ownership authority for the product command census and
runtime mounts. It declares **exactly** the five product families —
``projects``, ``media``, ``tasks``, ``runs``, and ``timelines`` — and attaches
the two nested mounts (``shots`` beneath ``timelines`` and ``references``
beneath ``media``). The mount table is code-declared because the workspace
runtime, not Astrid, owns the database schema and migration stream.

Rules enforced before any dispatch (sense check SC25):

The fixed table is validated for duplicate and unexpected paths before
dispatch. There is no schema loader, local schema registry, or dynamic mount
source, so a mount from an unreviewed source is impossible by construction.

The product census also excludes the operational commands (``serve``,
``doctor``, ``backup``): they are never part of the five-family product
registry, help, or product dispatch.

The dispatch boundary (:func:`run_product_family`) composes one
``AstridClient`` and passes it to the family's in-tree parser builder, so
every product handler is a rule-free SDK adapter (m4 plan step 24).
