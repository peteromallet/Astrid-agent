"""Read-only readiness checks for generation backends.

The public generation facade performs these checks before handing work to the
kernel.  They intentionally inspect only local installation state; they do
not start ComfyUI, import the optional VibeComfy stack, create staging
directories, or make a network request.

Astrid's local adapter uses VibeComfy to start a managed ComfyUI server for a
one-shot run.  Therefore a live server endpoint is *not* a prerequisite for
the managed path and an offline endpoint must not be reported as an
unsupported installation.  Endpoint reachability belongs to the runtime
startup error, after admission, when the installation is otherwise ready.
