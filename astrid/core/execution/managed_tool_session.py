"""Engine-neutral custody and fencing for one GenericPackHost tool session.

The Runtime remains the durable task/settlement authority.  This module only
owns the in-process lease around an engine session: its observed binding,
capacity slot, lifecycle generation, and one-shot admission tokens.  Engine
adapters are deliberately duck-typed so the same proof surface can cover
VibeComfy, Wan2GP, and future local tools without making this module an engine
router.
