"""Context-managed ``AstridClient`` lifecycle over the standard application.

(m4 plan step 18, task T19.) ``AstridClient.open()`` composes the standard
application (``astrid.application.compose_standard_application``) and binds
the client to it, exposing the seven typed application-owned services —
``projects``, ``timelines``, ``media``, ``tasks``, ``runs``,
``references``, and ``shots`` — as typed attributes. The client performs
**no service construction of its own**: every service is wired by the
application composition (plan step 17), and the client only surfaces the
already-composed instances.

Lazy capability APIs are preserved on the client exactly as on
``astrid.sdk``: ``discover``, ``get_capability``, typed ``invoke``,
``generate`` (the :class:`~astrid.sdk.generation.GenerationFacade`),
``render``, and the verified event reads (``read_events`` /
``subscribe_events``). Each delegates to the module-level SDK function at
call time, so the heavy capability machinery is imported only when a
capability API is actually used. Invocation results keep their result IDs
(``InvocationResult.run_id`` / ``run_root``) and outputs untouched.

Import behavior is deliberately lightweight: importing this module (or
``astrid``) opens no database, composes no registry, and imports no heavy
execution module. The application composition is imported lazily inside
:meth:`AstridClient.open` — the first moment a database is actually
required.
